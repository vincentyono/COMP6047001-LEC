109.   _Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
110.   He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
111.   He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:
112.                       His truth is marching on._
113. 
114.   _I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
115.   They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
116.   I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.
117.                       His day is marching on._
118. 
119.   _I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:
120.   “As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;
121.   Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,
122.                       Since God is marching on.”_
123. 
124.   _He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
125.   He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat:
126.   Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!
127.                       Our God is marching on._
128. 
129.   _In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
130.   With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me:
131.   As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
132.                       While God is marching on._

144. THE ANTI-SLAVERY PRELUDE TO THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF THE CIVIL WAR
145. 
146. The encroachments of the slave power on Northern soil--Green Peace,
147.   the home of Julia Ward Howe, a center of anti-slavery activity--She
148.   assists her husband, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, in editing the
149.   _Commonwealth_--He is made chairman of the Vigilance Committee--Slave
150.   concealed at Green Peace--Charles Sumner is struck down in the United
151.   States Senate.
152. 
153. 
154. The “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” “the crimson flower of battle,”
155. bloomed in a single night. It sprang from the very soil of the
156. conflict, in the midst of the Civil War. Yet the plant which produced
157. it was of slow growth, with roots reaching far back into the past.
158. 
159. In order to understand how this song of our nation sprang into sudden
160. being we must study that stormy past--the prelude of the Civil War.
161. How greatly it affected my mother we shall see from her own record, as
162. well as from the story of the events that touched her so nearly. My
163. own memory of them dates back to childhood’s days. Yet they moved and
164. stirred my soul as few things have done in a long life.
165. 
166. Therefore I have striven to give to the present generation some idea
167. of the fervor and ferment, the exaltation of spirit, that prevailed at
168. that epoch among the soldiers of a great cause, especially as I saw it
169. in our household.
170. 
171.        *       *       *       *       *
172. 
173.   Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel.
174. 
175. So many years have elapsed since the evil monster of slavery was done
176. to death that we sometimes forget its awful power in the middle of the
177. last century. The fathers of the Republic believed that it would soon
178. perish. They forbade its entrance into the Territories and were careful
179. to make no mention of it in the Constitution.
180. 
181. The invention of the cotton-gin changed the whole situation. It was
182. found that slave labor could be used with profit in the cultivation
183. of the cotton crop. But slave labor with its wasteful methods
184. exhausted the soil. Slavery could only be made profitable by constantly
185. increasing its area. Hence, the Southern leaders departed from the
186. policy of the fathers of the Republic. Instead of allowing slavery
187. to die out, they determined to make it perpetual. Instead of keeping
188. it within the limits prescribed by the ancient law of the land, they
189. resolved to extend it.
190. 
191. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 gave the first extension of slavery,
192. opening the great Territory of Missouri to the embrace of the serpent.
193. The fugitive-slave law was signed in 1850. Before this time the return
194. of runaway negroes had been an uncertain obligation. The new law took
195. away from State magistrates the decision in cases of this sort and gave
196. it to United States Commissioners. It imposed penalties on rescues and
197. denied a jury trial to black men arrested as fugitives, thus greatly
198. endangering the liberties of free negroes. The Dred Scott decision
199. (see page 10), denying that negroes could be citizens, was made in
200. 1854. In 1856 the Missouri Compromise was repealed by the Kansas and
201. Nebraska law.[1] Additional territory was thrown open to the sinister
202. institution which now threatened to become like the great Midgard
203. snake, holding our country in its suffocating embrace, as that creature
204. of fable surrounded the earth. It was necessary to fling off the deadly
205. coils of slavery if we were to endure as a free nation.
206. 
207. The first step was to arouse the sleeping conscience of the people. For
208. the South was not alone in wishing there should be no interference with
209. their “peculiar institution.” The North was long supine and dreaded any
210. new movement that might interfere with trade and national prosperity.
211. I can well remember my father’s pointing this out to his children, and
212. inveighing against the selfishness of the merchants as a class. Alas!
213. it was a Northern man, Stephen A. Douglas, who was the father of the
214. Kansas and Nebraska bill.
215. 
216. “The trumpet note of Garrison” had sounded, some years before this
217. time, the first note of anti-slavery protest. But the Garrisonian
218. abolitionists did not seek to carry the question into politics. Indeed,
219. they held it to be wrong to vote under the Federal Constitution,
220. “A league with death and a covenant with hell,” as they called it.
221. Whittier, the Quaker poet, took a more practical view than his
222. fellow-abolitionists and advocated the use of the ballot-box.
223. 
224. When the encroachments of the slave power began to threaten seriously
225. free institutions throughout the country, thinking men at the North saw
226. that the time for political action had come. There were several early
227. organizations which preceded the formation of the Republican party--the
228. Liberty party, Conscience Whigs, Free-soilers, as they were called.
229. My father belonged to the two latter, and I can well remember that my
230. elder sister and I were nicknamed at school, “Little Free-Dirters.”
231. 
232. The election of Charles Sumner to the United States Senate was an
233. important victory for the anti-slavery men. Dr. Howe, as his most
234. intimate friend, worked hard to secure it. Yet we see by my father’s
235. letters that he groaned in spirit at the necessity of the political
236. dickering which he hated.
237. 
238. Women in those days neither spoke in public nor took part in political
239. affairs. But it may be guessed that my mother was deeply interested
240. in all that was going on in the world of affairs, and under her own
241. roof, too, for our house at South Boston became one of the centers of
242. activity of the anti-slavery agitation.
243. 
244. My father (who was some seventeen years older than his wife) well
245. understood the power of the press. He had employed it to good effect
246. in his work for the blind, the insane, and others. Hence he became
247. actively interested in the management of the _Commonwealth_, an
248. anti-slavery newspaper, and with my mother’s help edited it for an
249. entire winter. They began work together every morning, he preparing the
250. political articles, and she the literary ones. Burning words were sent
251. forth from the quiet precincts of “Green Peace.” My mother had thus
252. named the homestead, lying in its lovely garden, when she came there
253. early in her married life. Little did she then dream that the repeal of
254. the Missouri Compromise would disturb its serene repose some ten years
255. later.
256. 
257. The agitation had not yet become so strong as greatly to affect the
258. children of the household. We played about the garden as usual and
259. knew little of the _Commonwealth_ undertaking, save as it brought some
260. delightful juveniles to the editorial sanctum. The little Howes highly
261. approved of this by-product of journalism!
262. 
263. Our mother’s pen had been used before this time to help the cause of
264. the slave. As early as 1848 she contributed a poem to _The Liberty
265. Bell_, an annual edited by Mrs. Maria Norton Chapman and sold at the
266. anti-slavery bazars. “In my first published volume, _Passion Flowers_,
267. appeared some lines ‘On the Death of the Slave Lewis,’ which were wrung
268. from my indignant heart by a story--alas! too common in those days--of
269. murderous outrage committed by a master against his human chattel”
270. (_Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Struggle_, Julia Ward Howe).
271. 
272. Another method of arousing the conscience of the nation was through
273. the public platform. My father and his friends were anxious to present
274. the great question in a perfectly fair way. So a series of lectures
275. was given in Tremont Temple, where the speakers were alternately the
276. most prominent advocates of slavery at the South and its most strenuous
277. opponents at the North. Senator Toombs, of Georgia, and General
278. Houston, of Texas, were among the former.
279. 
280. It was, probably, at this lecture course that my father exercised his
281. office as chairman in an unusual way. In those days it was the custom
282. to open the meeting with prayer, and some of the contemporary clergymen
283. were very long-winded. Dr. Howe informed each reverend gentleman
284. beforehand that at the end of five minutes he should pull the latter’s
285. coat-tail. The divines were in such dread of this gentle admonition
286. that they invariably wound up the prayer within the allotted time.
287. 
288. At this time no criticism of the “peculiar institution” was allowed
289. at the South. Northerners traveling there were often asked for their
290. opinion of it, but any unfavorable comment evoked displeasure. Indeed,
291. a friend of ours, a Northern woman teaching in Louisiana, was called
292. to book because in his presence she spoke of one of the slaves as a
293. “man.” A negro, she was informed, was not a man, and must never be so
294. called. “Boy” was the proper term to use. This was a logical inference
295. from Judge Taney’s famous Dred Scott decision--_viz._, that “such
296. persons,” _i. e._, negroes, “were not included among the people” in
297. the words of the Declaration of Independence, and could not in any
298. respect be considered as citizens. Yet, to quote Abraham Lincoln
299. again, “Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in five
300. of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
301. New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters,
302. and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the
303. Constitution that the white people had.”
304. 
305. Events now began to move with ever-increasing rapidity. The scenes of
306. the stirring prelude to the Civil War grew ever more stormy. Men became
307. more and more wrought up as the relentless purpose of the Southern
308. leaders was gradually revealed. The deadly serpent of slavery became a
309. hydra-headed monster, striking north, east, and west. The hunting of
310. fugitive slaves took on a sinister activity in the Northern “border”
311. States; at the national capital the attempts to muzzle free speech
312. culminated in the striking down of Charles Sumner in the Senate Chamber
313. itself; in Kansas the “border ruffians” strove to inaugurate a reign
314. of terror, and succeeded in bringing on a local conflict which was the
315. true opening of the Civil War.
316. 
317. The men who combated the dragon of slavery--the Siegfrieds of that
318. day--fought him in all these directions. In Boston Dr. Howe was among
319. the first to organize resistance to the rendition of fugitive slaves.
320. An escaped negro was kidnapped there in 1846. This was four years
321. before the passage by Congress of the fugitive-slave law made it the
322. duty (!) of the Free States to return runaway negroes to slavery. My
323. father called a meeting of protest at Faneuil Hall. He was the chief
324. speaker and “every sentence was a sword-thrust” (T. W. Higginson’s
325. account). I give a brief extract from his address:
326. 
327. “The peculiar institution which has so long been brooding over the
328. country like an incubus has at length spread abroad its murky wings and
329. has covered us with its benumbing shadow. It has silenced the pulpit,
330. it has muffled the press; its influence is everywhere.... Court Street
331. can find no way of escape for the poor slave. State Street, that drank
332. the blood of the martyrs of liberty--State Street is deaf to the cry
333. of the oppressed slave; the port of Boston that has been shut up by a
334. tyrant king as the dangerous haunt of free-men--the port of Boston has
335. been opened to the slave-trader; for God’s sake, Mr. Chairman, let us
336. keep Faneuil Hall free!”
337. 
338. Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and Theodore Parker also spoke. John
339. Quincy Adams presided at the meeting.
340. 
341. The meeting resulted in the formation of a vigilance committee of
342. forty, with my father as chairman. This continued its work until
343. the hunting of fugitives ceased in Boston. Secrecy necessarily
344. characterized its proceedings. An undated note from Dr. Howe to
345. Theodore Parker gives us a hint of them:
346. 
347.   [2]DEAR T. P.--Write me a note by bearer. Tell him merely whether I am
348.   wanted to-night; if I am he will act accordingly about bringing my
349.   wagon.
350. 
351.   I could bring any one here and keep him secret a week and no person
352.   except Mrs. H. and myself would know it.
353.                                                Yours,
354.                                                                 CHEV.[3]
355. 
356. This letter raises an interesting question. Were fugitives concealed,
357. unknown to us children, in our house? It is quite possible, for both
358. our parents could keep a secret. I remember a young white girl who was
359. so hidden from her drunken father until other arrangements could be
360. made for her. I remember also a negro girl, hardly more than a child,
361. who was secreted beneath the roof of Green Peace. Her mistress had
362. brought her to Boston as a servant. Since she was not a runaway, the
363. provisions of the odious fugitive-slave law did not apply to her. Here
364. at least we could cry:
365. 
366.   No fetters in the Bay State!
367.   No slave upon her land!
368. 
369. My father applied to the courts and in due process of time Martha was
370. declared free--so long as she remained on Northern soil. It may be
371. guessed that she did not care to return to the South!
372. 
373. The feeling of the community was strongly opposed to taking part in
374. slave-hunts. Yankee ingenuity often found a way to escape this odious
375. task, and yet keep within the letter of the law.
376. 
377. A certain United States marshal thus explained his proceedings:
378. 
379. “Why, I never have any trouble about runaway slaves. If I hear that one
380. has come to Boston I just go up to Nigger Hill [a part of Joy Street]
381. and say to them, ‘Do you know of any runaway slaves about here?’ And
382. they never do!”
383. 
384. This was a somewhat unique way of giving notice to the friends of the
385. fugitive that the officers of the law were after him.
386. 
387. If he could only escape over the border into free Canada he was safe.
388. According to the English law no slave could remain such on British
389. soil. The moment he “shook the Lion’s paw” he became free. Our law in
390. these United States is founded on the English Common Law. Alas! the
391. pro-slavery party succeeded in overthrowing it. No wonder that Senator
392. Toombs, of Georgia, boasted that he would call the roll of his slaves
393. under the shadow of Bunker Hill Monument. The fugitive-slave law gave
394. him the power to do this, and thus make our boasted freedom of the soil
395. only an empty mockery.
396. 
397. The vigilance committee did its work well, and for some time no runaway
398. slaves were captured in Boston. One poor wretch was finally caught. My
399. mother thus describes the event:
400. 
401. “At last a colored fugitive, Anthony Burns by name, was captured and
402. held subject to the demands of his owner. The day of his rendition was
403. a memorable one in Boston. The courthouse was surrounded by chains
404. and guarded with cannon. The streets were thronged with angry faces.
405. Emblems of mourning hung from several business and newspaper offices.
406. With a show of military force the fugitive was marched through the
407. streets. No rescue was attempted at this time, although one had been
408. planned for an earlier date. The ordinance was executed; Burns was
409. delivered to his master. But the act once consummated in broad daylight
410. could never be repeated” (from Julia Ward Howe’s _Recollections of the
411. Anti-Slavery Struggle_).
412. 
413. So great was the public indignation against the judge who had allowed
414. himself to be the instrument of the Federal Government in the return of
415. Burns to slavery that he was removed from office. Shortly afterward he
416. left Boston and went to live in Washington.
417. 
418. The attempts to enforce the fugitive-slave law at the East failed,
419. as they were bound to fail. The efforts to muzzle free speech at the
420. national capital were more successful for a time.
421. 
422. The task of Charles Sumner in upholding the principles of freedom in
423. the United States Senate was colossal. For long he stood almost alone,
424. “A voice crying in the wilderness, make straight the paths of the
425. Lord.” Fortunately he was endowed by nature with a commanding figure
426. and presence and a wonderful voice that fitted him perfectly for his
427. great task. My mother thus described him:
428. 
429. “He was majestic in person, habitually reserved and rather distant in
430. manner, but sometimes unbent to a smile in which the real geniality
431. of his soul seemed to shed itself abroad. His voice was ringing and
432. melodious, his gestures somewhat constrained, his whole manner, like
433. his matter, weighty and full of dignity.”
434. 
435. As an old and intimate friend, my father sometimes urged him to greater
436. haste in his task of combating slavery at the national capital. Thus
437. Charles Sumner writes to him from Washington, February 1, 1854:
438. 
439.   DEAR HOWE--Do not be impatient with me. I am doing all that I can.
440.   This great wickedness disturbs my sleep, my rest, my appetite.
441.   Much is to be done, of which the world knows nothing, in rallying
442.   an opposition. It has been said by others, that but for Chase and
443.   Sumner this Bill would have been rushed through at once, even without
444.   debate. Douglas himself told me that our opposition was the only
445.   sincere opposition he had to encounter. But this is not true. There
446.   are others here who are in earnest.
447. 
448.   My longing is to rally the country against the Bill[4] and I desire
449.   to let others come forward and broaden our front.
450. 
451.   Our Legislature ought to speak _unanimously_. Our people should
452.   revive the old report and resolutions of 1820.[5]
453. 
454.   At present our first wish is delay, that the country may be aroused.
455. 
456.   “Would that night or Blücher had come!”
457. 
458.   God bless you always!
459.                                                                    C. S.
460. 
461. In the fateful spring of 1856 Dr. and Mrs. Howe were in Washington.
462. They saw both Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks. My mother has given us
463. pictures of the two men as she then saw them:
464. 
465. “Charles Sumner looked up and, seeing me in the gallery, greeted me
466. with a smile of recognition. I shall never forget the beauty of that
467. smile. It seemed to me to illuminate the whole precinct with a silvery
468. radiance. There was in it all the innocence of his sweet and noble
469. nature.”[6]
470. 
471. “At Willard’s Hotel I observed at a table near our own a typical
472. Southerner of that time, handsome, but with a reckless and defiant
473. expression of countenance which struck me unpleasantly. This was
474. Preston Brooks, of South Carolina.”[7]
475. 
476. During one of his visits to the Howes, Sumner said:
477. 
478. “I shall soon deliver a speech in the Senate which will occasion a good
479. deal of excitement. It will not surprise me if people leave their seats
480. and show signs of unusual disturbance.”
481. 
482. My mother comments thus:
483. 
484. “At the moment I did not give much heed to his words, but they came
485. back to me, not much later, with the force of prophecy. For Mr. Sumner
486. did make this speech, and though at the moment nothing was done against
487. him, the would-be assassin only waited for a more convenient season
488. to spring upon his victim and to maim him for life. Choosing a moment
489. when Mr. Sumner’s immediate friends were not in the Senate Chamber,
490. Brooks of South Carolina, armed with a cane of india-rubber, attacked
491. him in the rear, knocking him from his seat with one blow, and beating
492. him about the head until he lay bleeding and senseless upon the floor.
493. Although the partisans of the South openly applauded this deed, its
494. cowardly brutality was really repudiated by all who had any sense of
495. honor, without geographical distinction. The blow, fatal to Sumner’s
496. health, was still more fatal to the cause it was meant to serve, and
497. even to the man who dealt it. Within one year his murderous hand was
498. paralyzed in death, and Sumner, after hanging long between life and
499. death, stood once more erect, with the aureole of martyrdom on his
500. brow, and with the dear-bought glory of his scars a more potent witness
501. for the truth than ever. His place in the Senate remained for a time
502. eloquently empty.”[8]
503. 
504. Hon. Miles Taylor, of Louisiana, defended in the Senate the attack on
505. Sumner. A part of his speech makes curious reading:
506. 
507. “If this new dogma” (the evil of slavery) “should be received by
508. the American people with favor, it can only be when all respect
509. for revelation ... has been utterly swept away by such a flood of
510. irreligion and foul philosophy as never before set in.”
511. 
512. 
513. 
514. 
515. II
516. 
517. THE CRIME AGAINST KANSAS
518. 
519. Border ruffians from Missouri carry Kansas elections with pistol
520.   and bowie-knife. They prevent peaceable Free State emigrants from
521.   entering the national territory--Dr. Howe carries out aid from
522.   New England--Clergymen and Sharp’s rifles--Mrs. Howe’s indignant
523.   verses--She opens the door for John Brown, the hero of the war in
524.   Kansas--Gov. Andrew, Theodore Parker, Charles Sumner--The attack on
525.   Fort Sumter--“The death-blow of slavery.”
526. 
527. 
528. These assaults by the serpent of slavery on the free institutions of
529. the North and East were dangerous enough, yet, like other evils, they
530. brought their own remedies with them. Such an open attack on free
531. speech as that on Sumner was sure to be resented, while the forcible
532. carrying-off of fugitive slaves under the shadow of old Faneuil Hall
533. aroused a degree of wrath that even the pro-slavery leaders saw was
534. ominous.
535. 
536. “The crime against Kansas” was still more alarming because it
537. threatened to turn a free Territory into a slave State. In 1854 the
538. Kansas and Nebraska bill had been passed, repealing the Missouri
539. Compromise and exposing a vast area of virgin soil to the encroachments
540. of the “peculiar institution.”
541. 
542. The Free-soil men were speedily on the alert. During that same year of
543. 1854 two Massachusetts colonies were sent out to Kansas, others going
544. later.
545. 
546. But the leaders of the slave power had no intention of allowing men
547. from the free States to settle peacefully in Kansas. They had repealed
548. the Missouri Compromise with the express purpose of gaining a new slave
549. State, and this was to be accomplished by whatever means were necessary.
550. 
551. It was an easy matter to send men from Missouri into the adjacent
552. Territory of Kansas--to vote there and then to return to their homes
553. across the Mississippi.
554. 
555. The New York _Herald_ of April 20, 1855, published the following letter
556. from a correspondent in Brunswick, Missouri:
557. 
558.   From five to seven thousand men started from Missouri to attend the
559.   election, some to remove, but the most to return to their families,
560.   with an intention, if they liked the Territory, to make it their
561.   permanent abode at the earliest moment practicable. But they intended
562.   to vote.... Indeed, every county furnished its quota; and when they
563.   set out it looked like an army.... They were armed.... Fifteen
564.   hundred wore on their hats bunches of hemp. They were resolved if a
565.   tyrant attempted to trample upon the rights of the sovereign people
566.   to hang him.
567. 
568. It will be noted that “the rights of the sovereign people” were to go
569. to the ballot-box not in their own, but in another State. These “border
570. ruffians” took possession of the polls and carried the first election
571. with pistol and bowie-knife.
572. 
573. The pro-slavery leaders strove to drive out the colonists from the free
574. States and to prevent additional emigrants from entering the Territory.
575. A campaign of frightfulness was inaugurated--with the usual result.
576. 
577. Governor Geary of Kansas, although a pro-slavery official himself,
578. wrote (Dec. 22, 1856) that he heartily despised the abolitionists, but
579. that “_The persecutions of the Free State men here were not exceeded by
580. those of the early Christians._”
581. 
582. My father was deeply interested in the colonization of Kansas and in
583. the struggle for freedom within its borders. He helped in 1854 to
584. organize the “New England Emigrant Aid Company” which assisted parties
585. of settlers to go to the Territory. In 1856 matters began to look very
586. dark for the colonists from the free States. “Dr. Howe was stirred to
587. his highest activity by the news from Kansas and by the brutal assault
588. on Charles Sumner” (F. B. Sanborn). With others he called and organized
589. the Faneuil Hall meeting. He was made chairman of its committee, and
590. at once sent two thousand dollars to St. Louis for use in Kansas. This
591. prompt action had an important effect on the discouraged settlers. Soon
592. afterward he started for Kansas to give further aid to the colonists.
593. 
594. “I have traversed the whole length of the State of Iowa on horseback
595. or in a cart, sleeping in said cart or in worse lodgings, among dirty
596. men on the floor of dirty huts. We have organized a pretty good line of
597. communication between our base and the corps of emigrants who have now
598. advanced into the Territory of Nebraska. Everything depends upon the
599. success of the attempt to break through the _cordon infernale_ which
600. Missouri has drawn across the northern frontier of Kansas.”[9]
601. 
602. In another letter he writes:
603. 
604.   The boats on the river are beset by spies and ruffians, are hauled up
605.   at various places and thoroughly searched for anti-slavery men.
606. 
607. He thus describes the emigrants:[10]
608. 
609.                              CAMP OF THE EMIGRATION, NEBRASKA TERRITORY,
610.                                                          _July 29, ’56_.
611. 
612.   The emigration is indeed a noble one; sturdy, industrious, temperate,
613.   resolute men.... I wish our friends in the East could know the
614.   character and behavior of these emigrants. They are and have been
615.   for two weeks encamped out upon these vast prairies in their tents
616.   and waggons waiting patiently for the signal to move, exhausting all
617.   peaceful resources and negotiations before resorting to force.
618. 
619.   There is no liquor in the whole camp; no smoking, no swearing, no
620.   irregularity. They drink cold water, live mostly on mush and rice
621.   and the simplest, cheapest fare. They have instruction for the
622.   little children; they have Sunday-schools, prayer-meetings, and are
623.   altogether a most sober and earnest community. Most of the loafers
624.   have dropped off. The Wisconsin company, about one hundred, give a
625.   tone to all the others. I could give you a picture of the drunken,
626.   rollicking ruffians who oppose this emigration--but you know it. Will
627.   the North allow such an emigration to be shut out of the National
628.   Territory by such brigands?
629. 
630. In another letter he tells us that among the emigrants were
631. thirty-eight women and children--grandfathers and grandmothers, too,
632. journeying with their live stock in carts drawn by oxen to the promised
633. land.
634. 
635. He says nothing of danger to himself, but Hon. Andrew D. White tells us
636. that “Dr. Howe had braved death again and again while aiding the Free
637. State men against the pro-slavery myrmidons of Kansas.”
638. 
639. The strength of the movement may be judged from the fact that during
640. this year (1856) the people of Massachusetts sent one hundred thousand
641. dollars in money, clothing, and arms to help the Free State colonists.
642. This money did not come from the radicals only, but from “Hunkers,” as
643. they were then called--_i. e._, conservative and well-to-do citizens.
644. My father wrote: “People pay readily here for Sharp’s rifles. One lady
645. offered me one hundred dollars the other day, and to-day a clergyman
646. offered me one hundred dollars.”
647. 
648. My mother was greatly moved by these tragic events--the assault
649. on Sumner and the civil war in Kansas. In _Words for the Hour_--a
650. volume of her poems published in 1857--we find a record of her just
651. indignation. In the “Sermon of Spring” she describes Kansas as:
652. 
653.   Wearing the green nodding plumes of the Court of the Prairie,
654.   Gyves on her free-born limbs, on her fair arms shackles,
655.   Blood on her garments, terror and grief in her features.
656.   “Tremble,” she cried, “tho’ the battle seem thine for a season,
657.   Not a drop of my blood shall be wanting to judge thee.
658.   Tremble, thou fallen from mercy ere fallen from office.”
659. 
660. This poem, which is a long one, contains a tribute to Sumner, as do
661. also “Tremont Temple,” “The Senator’s Return,” and “An Hour in the
662. Senate.” I give a brief extract from the last named:
663. 
664.   Falls there no lightning from yon distant heaven
665.     To crush this man’s potential impudence?
666.     Shall not its outraged patience thunder: “Hence!
667.   Forsake the shrine where Liberty was given!”
668. 
669.   “The strong shall rule, the arm of force have sway,
670.     The helpless multitude in bonds abide--”
671.     Again the chuckle and the shake of pride--
672.   “God’s for the stronger--so great Captains say.”
673. 
674.          *       *       *       *       *
675. 
676.   Yet, rise to answer, chafing in thy chair,
677.     With soul indignant stirred, and flushing brow.
678.     Thou art God’s candidate--speak soothly now,
679.   Let every word anticipate a prayer.
680. 
681.   Gather in thine the outstretched hands that strive
682.     To help thy pleading, agonized and dumb;
683.     Bear up the hearts whose silent sorrows come
684.   For utterance, to the voice that thou canst give.
685. 
686. In the same volume are verses entitled “Slave Eloquence” and “Slave
687. Suicide.”
688. 
689. How did the children of the household feel during this period of “Sturm
690. und Drang”? To the older ones, at least, it was a most exciting time.
691. While we did not by any means know of all that was going on, we felt
692. very strongly the electric current of indignation that thrilled through
693. our home, as well as the stir of action. My father early taught us to
694. love freedom and to hate slavery. He gave us, in brief, clear outline,
695. the story of the aggressions of the slave power. We knew of the
696. iniquity of the Dred Scott decision before we were in our teens. Child
697. that I was, I was greatly moved when he repeated Lowell’s well-known
698. lines:
699. 
700.   Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--
701.   Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,
702.   Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.
703. 
704. My father had always something of the soldier about him--a quick,
705. active step, gallant bearing, and a voice tender, yet strong, “A voice
706. to lead a regiment.” This was the natural consequence of his early
707. experiences in the Greek War of Independence, when he served some
708. seven years as surgeon, soldier, and--most important of all--almoner
709. of America’s bounty to the peaceful population. The latter would have
710. perished of starvation save for the supplies sent out in response to
711. Dr. Howe’s appeals to his countrymen. The greater part of his life was
712. devoted to the healing arts of the good physician. Yet the portraits of
713. him, taken during the tremendous struggle of the anti-slavery period,
714. show a sternness not visible in his younger nor yet in his later days.
715. 
716. In her poem “A Rough Sketch” my mother described him as he seemed to
717. her at this time:
718. 
719.   A great grieved heart, an iron will,
720.     As fearless blood as ever ran;
721.   A form elate with nervous strength
722.     And fibrous vigor,--all a man.
723. 
724. Charles Sumner came often to Green Peace when he was in Boston. We
725. children greatly admired him. He seemed to us, and doubtless to others,
726. a species of superman. I can hardly think of those days without the
727. organ accompaniment of his voice--deeper than the depths, round and
728. full. When our friend was stricken down in the Senate, great was our
729. youthful indignation. Many were the arguments held with our mates at
730. school and dancing-school, often the children of the “Hunker” class.
731. They sought to justify the attack, and we replied with the testimony
732. of an eye-witness to the scene (Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President
733. of the United States) and the fact that a colleague of Brooks stood,
734. waving a pistol[11] in each hand, to prevent any interference in behalf
735. of Sumner. We had heard about the cruel “Mochsa” with which his back
736. was burned in the hope of cure, and we lamented his sufferings.
737. 
738. John A. Andrew, afterward the War Governor of the State, was another
739. intimate of our household, a great friend of both our parents.
740. Genial and merry, as a rule, he yet could be sternly eloquent in the
741. denunciation of slavery.
742. 
743. Indeed, it was a speech of this nature which first brought him into
744. prominence. In the Massachusetts Legislature of 1858 the most striking
745. figure was that of Caleb Cushing. He had been Attorney-General in
746. President Franklin Pierce’s Cabinet and was one of the ablest lawyers
747. in the United States. When all were silent before his oratory and
748. no one felt equal to opposing this master of debate, Andrew, a young
749. advocate, was moved, like another David, to attack his Goliath. In a
750. speech of great eloquence he vindicated the action of the Governor and
751. the Legislature in removing from office the judge who had sent Anthony
752. Burns back into slavery and thus outraged the conscience of the Bay
753. State. As a lawyer he sustained his opinion by legal precedents.
754. 
755. “When he took his seat there was a storm of applause. The House was
756. wild with excitement. Some members cried for joy; others cheered,
757. waved their handkerchiefs, and threw whatever they could find into the
758. air.”[12]
759. 
760. And so, like David, he won not only the battle of the day, but the
761. leadership of his people in the stormy times that soon followed.
762. 
763. When a box of copperhead snakes was sent to our beloved Governor we
764. were again indignant. (Political opponents had not then learned to send
765. gifts of bombs.)
766. 
767. From Kansas itself Martin F. Conway came to us, full of fiery zeal for
768. the Free State cause, although born south of Mason and Dixon’s line.
769. 
770. He later represented the young State in Congress. Samuel Downer
771. and George L. Stearns we often saw; both were very active in the
772. anti-slavery cause. The latter was remarkable for a very long and
773. beautiful beard, brown and soft, like a woman’s hair and reaching to
774. his waist.
775. 
776. We heard burning words about the duty of Massachusetts during these
777. assaults of the slave power. Could she endure them, or should she not
778. rather seek to withdraw from the Union?
779. 
780. These words sound strangely to us now, but it must be remembered that
781. in the fifties we had seen our fair Bay State made an annex to slave
782. territory. Men might well ask one another, “Can the Commonwealth of
783. Massachusetts endure the disgrace of having slave-hunts within her
784. borders?” “The Irrepressible Conflict” had come. When the pro-slavery
785. leaders forced the fugitive-slave law through Congress they struck a
786. blow at the life of the nation as deadly as that of Fort Sumter. The
787. latter was the inevitable sequel of the former.
788. 
789. We saw often at Green Peace another intimate friend of our
790. parents--Theodore Parker, the famous preacher and reformer. As he
791. wore spectacles and was prematurely bald, he did not leave upon our
792. childish minds the impression of grandeur inseparably connected with
793. Charles Sumner. Yet the splendid dome of his head gave evidence of his
794. great intellect, while his blue eyes looked kindly and often merrily
795. at us. Having no children of his own, he would have liked to adopt our
796. youngest sister, could our parents have been persuaded to part with her.
797. 
798. Theodore Parker advocated the anti-slavery cause with great eloquence
799. in the pulpit. He also belonged to my father’s vigilance committee
800. and harbored fugitive slaves in his own home. To one couple of
801. runaway negroes he presented a Bible and a sword--after marrying them
802. legally--a thing not always done in the day of slavery. My father
803. succeeded in sending away from Boston the man who attempted to carry
804. them back to the South, and William and Ellen Croft found freedom in
805. England.
806. 
807. Theodore Parker’s sermons had a powerful influence on his great
808. congregation, of which my mother was for some time a member. In one of
809. her tributes to him she tells us how he drew them all toward the light
810. of a better day and prepared them also for “the war of blood and iron.”
811. 
812. “I found that it was by the spirit of the higher humanity that he
813. brought his hearers into sympathy with all reforms and with the better
814. society that should ripen out of them. Freedom for black and white,
815. opportunity for man and woman, the logic of conscience and the logic
816. of progress--this was the discipline of his pulpit.... Before its [the
817. Civil War’s] first trumpet blast blew his great heart had ceased to
818. beat. But a great body of us remembered his prophecy and his strategy
819. and might have cried, as did Walt Whitman at a later date, ‘O captain,
820. my captain!’”[13]
821. 
822. Rev. James Freeman Clarke, our pastor for many years, was among those
823. whose visits gave pleasure and inspiration as well to our household. He
824. did not hesitate to preach anti-slavery doctrines, unpopular as they
825. were, from his pulpit. My mother says of him at this time:
826. 
827. “In the agitated period which preceded the Civil War and in that which
828. followed it he in his modest pulpit became one of the leaders, not
829. of his own flock alone, but of the community to which he belonged. I
830. can imagine few things more instructive and desirable than was his
831. preaching in those troublous times, so full of unanswered question and
832. unreconciled discord.”[14]
833. 
834. Her beloved minister was among those who accompanied my mother on the
835. visit to the army which inspired “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”
836. This was written to the tune of:
837. 
838.   John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the grave,
839.         His soul is marching on.
840. 
841. “Old Ossawotamie Brown” was the true hero of the bloody little war in
842. Kansas, where the Free State men finally prevailed, though many lives
843. were lost. He has been called “Savior of Kansas and Liberator of the
844. Slave.” He came at least once to Green Peace. My mother has described
845. her meeting with him. My father had told her some time previously about
846. a man who “seemed to intend to devote his life to the redemption of
847. the colored race from slavery, even as Christ had willingly offered
848. His life for the salvation of mankind.” One day he reminded her of
849. the person so described, and added: “That man will call here this
850. afternoon. You will receive him. His name is John Brown.”...
851. 
852. Later, my mother wrote of this meeting:
853. 
854. “At the expected time I heard the bell ring, and, on answering it,
855. beheld a middle-aged, middle-sized man, with hair and beard of amber
856. color streaked with gray. He looked a Puritan of the Puritans,
857. forceful, concentrated, and self-contained. We had a brief interview,
858. of which I only remember my great gratification at meeting one of whom
859. I had heard so good an account. I saw him once again at Dr. Howe’s
860. office, and then heard no more of him for some time.”[15]
861. 
862. Elsewhere she has written apropos of his raid at Harper’s Ferry:
863. 
864. “None of us could exactly approve an act so revolutionary in its
865. character, yet the great-hearted attempt enlisted our sympathies
866. very strongly. The weeks of John Brown’s imprisonment were very sad
867. ones, and the day of his death was one of general mourning in New
868. England.”[16]
869. 
870. With the election of Lincoln we seemed to come to smoother times. We
871. young people certainly did not realize that we were on the brink of
872. civil war, although friends who had visited the South warned us of the
873. preparations going on there. If there should be any struggle, it would
874. be a brief one, people said.
875. 
876. Suddenly, like a flash of lightning out of a clear sky, came the firing
877. on Sumter. My father came triumphantly into the nursery and called out
878. to his children: “Sumter has been fired upon! That’s the death-blow
879. of slavery.” Little did he or we realize how long and terrible the
880. conflict would be. But he knew that the serpent had received its
881. death-wound. All through the long and terrible war he cheered my mother
882. by his unyielding belief in the ultimate success of our arms.
883. 
884. So the prelude ended and the greater tragedy began. The conflict of
885. ideas, the most soul-stirring period of our history, passed into the
886. conflict of arms. In the midst of its agony the steadfast soul of a
887. woman saw the presage of victory and gave the message, a message never
888. to be forgotten, to her people and to the world.

894. 
895. MRS. HOWE VISITS THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC
896. 
897. The Civil War breaks out--Dr. Howe is appointed a member of the
898.   Sanitary Commission--Mrs. Howe accompanies him to Washington--She
899.   makes her maiden speech to a Massachusetts regiment--She sees the
900.   watch-fires of a hundred circling camps--She visits the army and her
901.   carriage is involved in a military movement--She is surrounded by
902.   “Burnished rows of steel.”
903. 
904. 
905. “The years between 1850 and 1857, eventful as they were, appear to me
906. almost a period of play when compared with the time of trial which was
907. to follow. It might have been likened to the tuning of instruments
908. before some great musical solemnity. The theme was already suggested,
909. but of its wild and terrible development who could have had any
910. foreknowledge?”
911. 
912. In her _Reminiscences_ my mother thus compares the Civil War and its
913. prelude. Again she says of the former:
914. 
915. “Its cruel fangs fastened upon the very heart of Boston and took from
916. us our best and bravest. From many a stately mansion father or son
917. went forth, followed by weeping, to be brought back for bitterer
918. sorrow.”
919. 
920. Mercifully she was spared this last. My father was too old for military
921. service and no longer in vigorous health, being in his sixtieth year
922. when the war broke out; my eldest brother was just thirteen years of
923. age. Nevertheless she was brought into close touch with the activities
924. of the great struggle from the beginning.
925. 
926. On the day when the news of the attack on Fort Sumter was received Dr.
927. Howe wrote to Governor Andrew, offering his services:
928. 
929. “Since they will have it so--in the name of God, Amen! Now let all the
930. governors and chief men of the people see to it that war shall not
931. cease until emancipation is secure. If I can be of any use, anywhere,
932. in any capacity (save that of spy), command me.”[17]
933. 
934. With what swiftness the “Great War Governor of Massachusetts” acted at
935. this time is matter of history. Two days after the President issued a
936. call for troops, three regiments started for Washington. Massachusetts
937. was thus the first State to come to the aid of the Union--the first,
938. alas! to have her sons struck down and slain.
939. 
940. Governor Andrew was glad to avail himself of Dr. Howe’s offer of aid.
941. The latter’s early experiences in Greece made his help and counsel
942. valuable both to the State and to the nation. Gen. Winfield Scott,
943. Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Governor Andrew requested him, on
944. May 2, 1861, to make a sanitary survey of the Massachusetts troops in
945. the field at and near the national capital. Before the end of the month
946. the Sanitary Commission was created, Dr. Howe being one of the original
947. members appointed by Abraham Lincoln.
948. 
949. Governor Andrew was almost overwhelmed with the manifold cares and
950. duties of his office. Our house was one of the places where he took
951. refuge when he greatly needed rest. He was obliged to give up going
952. to church early in the war because many people followed him there,
953. importuning him with requests of all sorts.
954. 
955. Thus the questions of the Civil War were brought urgently to my
956. mother’s mind in her own home, just as those of the anti-slavery period
957. had been a year or two before.
958. 
959. To quote her _Reminiscences_ again:
960. 
961. “The record of our State during the war was a proud one. The repeated
962. calls for men and for money were always promptly and generously
963. answered. And this promptness was greatly forwarded by the energy and
964. patriotic vigilance of the Governor. I heard much of this at the time,
965. especially from my husband, who was greatly attached to the Governor
966. and who himself took an intense interest in all the operations of the
967. war.... I seemed to live in and along with the war, while it was in
968. progress, and to follow all its ups and downs, its good and ill fortune
969. with these two brave men, Dr. Howe and Governor Andrew. Neither of them
970. for a moment doubted the final result of the struggle, but both they
971. and I were often very sad and much discouraged.”
972. 
973. Governor Andrew was often summoned to Washington. Dr. Howe’s duties
974. as a member of the Sanitary Commission also took him there. Thus it
975. happened that my mother went to the national capital in their company
976. in the late autumn of 1861. Mrs. Andrew, the Governor’s wife, Rev.
977. James Freeman Clarke, and Mr. and Mrs. Edwin P. Whipple were also of
978. the party.
979. 
980. As they drew near Washington they saw ominous signs of the dangers
981. encompassing the city. Mrs. Howe noticed little groups of armed men
982. sitting near a fire--pickets guarding the railroad, her husband told
983. her. For the Confederate Army was not far off, the Army of the Potomac
984. lying like a steel girdle about Washington, to protect it.
985. 
986. This was my mother’s first glimpse of the Union Army which later made
987. such a deep impression upon her mind and heart. I have always fancied,
988. though she does not say so, that some of the vivid images of the
989. “Battle Hymn” were suggested by the scenes of this journey.
990. 
991.   I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
992.   They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
993.   I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.
994.                                 His day is marching on!
995. 
996. Arrived at Washington, the party established themselves at Willard’s
997. Hotel. Evidences of the war were to be seen on all sides. Soldiers on
998. horseback galloped about the streets, while ambulances with four horses
999. passed by the windows and sometimes stopped before the hotel itself.
1000. Near at hand, my mother saw “The ghastly advertisement of an agency
1001. for embalming and forwarding the bodies of those who had fallen in
1002. the fight or who had perished by fever.”[18] In the vicinity of this
1003. establishment was the office of the New York _Herald_.
1004. 
1005. Governor Andrew and Dr. Howe were busy with their official duties;
1006. indeed, the former was under such a tremendous pressure of work and
1007. care that he died soon after the close of the war. The latter “carried
1008. his restless energy and indomitable will from camp to hospital, from
1009. battle-field to bureau.” His reports and letters show how deeply he was
1010. troubled by the lack of proper sanitation among the troops.
1011. 
1012. My mother again came in touch with the Army, visiting the camps and
1013. hospitals in the company of Mr. Clarke and the Rev. William Henry
1014. Channing. It need hardly be said that these excursions were made in no
1015. spirit of idle curiosity.
1016. 
1017. In ordinary times she would not look at a cut finger if she could help
1018. it. I remember her telling us of one dreadful woman who asked to be
1019. shown the worst wound in the hospital. As a result this morbid person
1020. was so overcome with the horror of it that the surgeon was obliged to
1021. leave his patient and attend to the visitor, while she went from one
1022. fainting fit into another!
1023. 
1024. Up to this time my mother had never spoken in public. It was from the
1025. Army of the Potomac that she first received the inspiration to do so.
1026. In company with her party of friends she had made “a reconnoitering
1027. expedition,” visiting, among other places, the headquarters of Col.
1028. William B. Greene, of the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery. The
1029. colonel, who was an old friend, warmly welcomed his visitors. Soon he
1030. said to my mother, “Mrs. Howe, you must speak to my men.” What did he
1031. see in her face that prompted him to make such a startling request?
1032. 
1033.        *       *       *       *       *
1034. 
1035. It must be remembered that in 1861 the women of our country were, with
1036. some notable exceptions, entirely unaccustomed to speaking in public.
1037. A few suffragists and anti-slavery leaders addressed audiences, but my
1038. mother had not at this time joined their ranks.
1039. 
1040. Yet she doubtless then possessed, although she did not know it, the
1041. power of thus expressing herself. Colonel Greene must have read in her
1042. face something of the emotion which poured itself out in the “Battle
1043. Hymn.” He must have known, too, that she had already written stirring
1044. verses. So he not only asked, but insisted that she should address the
1045. men under his command.
1046. 
1047. “Feeling my utter inability to do this, I ran away and tried to hide
1048. myself in one of the hospital tents. Colonel Greene twice found me and
1049. brought me back to his piazza, where at last I stood and told as well
1050. as I could how glad I was to meet the brave defenders of our cause and
1051. how constantly they were in my thoughts.”[19]
1052. 
1053. I fear there is no record of this, her maiden speech.
1054. 
1055. Throughout her long life church-going was a comfort, one might almost
1056. say a delight, to her. During this visit to Washington, where the weeks
1057. brought so many sad sights, she had the pleasure of listening on Sunday
1058. to the Rev. William Henry Channing. Love of his native land induced him
1059. to leave his pulpit in England and to return to this country in her
1060. hour of darkness and danger.
1061. 
1062. My mother tells us that this nephew of the great Dr. Channing was heir
1063. to the latter’s spiritual distinction and deeply stirred by enthusiasm
1064. in a noble cause. “On Sundays his voice rang out, clear and musical as
1065. a bell, within the walls of the Unitarian church”[20]--her own church.
1066. Thus she listened both in Washington and in Boston, her home city, to
1067. men who were patriots as well as priests.
1068. 
1069. As she tells the story, one sees how almost all the circumstances of
1070. her environment tended to promote her love of country and to stir the
1071. emotions of her deeply religious nature. It was by no accident that the
1072. national song which bears her name is a hymn. Written at that time and
1073. amid those surroundings, it could not have been anything else.
1074. 
1075. Among her cherished memories of this visit was an interview with
1076. Abraham Lincoln, arranged for the party by Governor Andrew. “I remember
1077. well the sad expression of Mr. Lincoln’s deep blue eyes, the only
1078. feature of his face which could be called other than plain.... The
1079. President was laboring at this time under a terrible pressure of doubt
1080. and anxiety.”[21]
1081. 
1082. The culminating event of her stay in Washington was the visit to the
1083. Army of the Potomac on the occasion of a review of troops. As the
1084. writing of the “Battle Hymn” was the immediate result of the memorable
1085. experiences of that day, I shall defer their consideration till the
1086. next chapter.
1087. 
1088. I have thus sketched briefly the train of events and experiences both
1089. before and during the Civil War which led up to the composition of this
1090. national hymn. The seed had lain germinating for years--at the last
1091. it sprang suddenly into being. My mother’s mind often worked in this
1092. way. It had a strongly philosophic tendency which made her think long
1093. and study deeply. But she possessed, also, the fervor of the poet.
1094. Her mental processes were often extremely rapid, especially under
1095. the stress of strong emotion. She herself thought the quick action
1096. of her mind was due to her red-haired temperament. The two opposing
1097. characteristics of her intellect, deliberation and speed, were perhaps
1098. the result of the mixed strains of her blood inherited from English and
1099. French ancestors.
1100. 
1101. The student of her life will note a number of sudden inspirations, or
1102. visions, as we may call them. Before these we can usually trace a long
1103. period of meditation and reflection. Her peace crusade, her conversion
1104. to the cause of woman suffrage, her dream of a golden time when men and
1105. women should work together for the betterment of the world, were all of
1106. this description.
1107. 
1108. The “Battle Hymn” was the most notable of these inspirations. In
1109. her _Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Struggle_ she ascribes its
1110. composition to two causes--the religion of humanity and the passion
1111. of patriotism. The former was a plant of slow growth. In her tribute
1112. to Theodore Parker,[22] she tells us how this developed under his
1113. preaching, and how he prepared his hearers for the war of blood and
1114. iron that soon followed.
1115. 
1116. My mother had long cherished love for her country, but it burned more
1117. intensely when the war came, bursting into sudden flame after that
1118. memorable day with the soldiers.
1119. 
1120. “When the war broke out, the passion of patriotism lent its color to
1121. the religion of humanity in my own mind, as in many others, and a
1122. moment came in which I could say:
1123. 
1124.   Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!
1125. 
1126. --and the echo which my words awoke in many hearts made me sure that
1127. many other people had seen it also.”[23]
1128. 
1129. 
1130. 
1131. 
1132. IV
1133. 
1134. “THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC”
1135. 
1136. “The crimson flower of battle blooms” in a single night--The vision
1137.   in the gray morning twilight--It is written down in the half-darkness
1138.   on her husband’s official paper of the U. S. Sanitary Commission--How
1139.   it was published in the _Atlantic Monthly_ and the price paid for
1140.   it--The John Brown air derived from a camp-meeting hymn--The simple
1141.   story in her own words.
1142. 
1143. 
1144. Over and over again, so many times that she lost count of them, was my
1145. mother asked to describe the circumstances under which she composed
1146. “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Fortunately she wrote them down, so
1147. that we are able to give “the simple story” in her own words.
1148. 
1149. The following account is taken in part from her _Reminiscences_ and in
1150. part from the leaflet printed in honor of her seventieth birthday, May
1151. 27, 1889, by the New England Woman’s Club. She was president of this
1152. association for about forty years:
1153. 
1154. “I distinctly remember that a feeling of discouragement came over me
1155. as I drew near the city of Washington. I thought of the women of my
1156. acquaintance whose sons or husbands were fighting our great battle; the
1157. women themselves serving in the hospitals or busying themselves with
1158. the work of the Sanitary Commission. My husband, as already said, was
1159. beyond the age of military service, my eldest son but a stripling; my
1160. youngest was a child of not more than two years. I could not leave my
1161. nursery to follow the march of our armies, neither had I the practical
1162. deftness which the preparing and packing of sanitary stores demanded.
1163. Something seemed to say to me, ‘You would be glad to serve, but you
1164. cannot help any one; you have nothing to give, and there is nothing for
1165. you to do.’ Yet, because of my sincere desire, a word was given me to
1166. say which did strengthen the hearts of those who fought in the field
1167. and of those who languished in prison.
1168. 
1169. “In the late autumn of the year 1861 I visited the national capital
1170. with my husband, Dr. Howe, and a party of friends, among whom were
1171. Governor and Mrs. Andrew, Mr. and Mrs. E. P. Whipple, and my dear
1172. pastor, Rev. James Freeman Clarke.
1173. 
1174. “The journey was one of vivid, even romantic, interest. We were about
1175. to see the grim Demon of War face to face, and long before we reached
1176. the city his presence made itself felt in the blaze of fires along the
1177. road, where sat or stood our pickets, guarding the road on which we
1178. traveled.
1179. 
1180. “One day we drove out to attend a review of troops, appointed to take
1181. place at some distance from the city. In the carriage with me were
1182. James Freeman Clarke and Mr. and Mrs. Whipple. The day was fine, and
1183. everything promised well, but a sudden surprise on the part of the
1184. enemy interrupted the proceedings before they were well begun. A small
1185. body of our men had been surrounded and cut off from their companions,
1186. re-enforcements were sent to their assistance, and the expected pageant
1187. was necessarily given up. The troops who were to have taken part in it
1188. were ordered back to their quarters, and we also turned our horses’
1189. heads homeward.
1190. 
1191. “For a long distance the foot soldiers nearly filled the road. They
1192. were before and behind, and we were obliged to drive very slowly. We
1193. presently began to sing some of the well-known songs of the war, and
1194. among them:
1195. 
1196.   ‘John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the grave.’
1197. 
1198. This seemed to please the soldiers, who cried, ‘Good for you,’ and
1199. themselves took up the strain. Mr. Clarke said to me, ‘You ought to
1200. write some new words to that tune.’ I replied that I had often wished
1201. to do so.
1202. 
1203. “In spite of the excitement of the day I went to bed and slept as
1204. usual, but awoke next morning in the gray of the early dawn, and to my
1205. astonishment found that the wished-for lines were arranging themselves
1206. in my brain. I lay quite still until the last verse had completed
1207. itself in my thoughts, then hastily arose, saying to myself, ‘I shall
1208. lose this if I don’t write it down immediately.’ I searched for a sheet
1209. of paper and an old stump of a pen which I had had the night before and
1210. began to scrawl the lines almost without looking, as I had learned to
1211. do by often scratching down verses in the darkened room where my little
1212. children were sleeping. Having completed this, I lay down again and
1213. fell asleep, but not without feeling that something of importance had
1214. happened to me.”
1215. 
1216. It will be noted that the first draft of the “Battle Hymn” was written
1217. on the back of a sheet of the letter-paper of the Sanitary Commission
1218. on which her husband was then serving. Mr. A. J. Bloor, the assistant
1219. secretary of that body, has called attention to this. His account of
1220. the eventful day is given at the close of this chapter.
1221. 
1222. My mother gave the original draft of the “Battle Hymn” to her friend,
1223. Mrs. Edwin P. Whipple, “who begged it of me, years ago.” Hence below
1224. the letter-heading:
1225. 
1226.   SANITARY COMMISSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.
1227.             TREASURY BUILDING
1228.                                  _1861_
1229. 
1230. we find the inscription
1231. 
1232.      WILLARD’S HOTEL
1233.       JULIA W. HOWE
1234.           TO
1235.   CHARLOTTE B. WHIPPLE
1236. 
1237. The draft remained for many years in the possession of the latter,
1238. until it was sent to Messrs. Houghton & Mifflin, in order to have a
1239. facsimile made for the _Reminiscences_.
1240. 
1241. Mr. and Mrs. Whipple were among the familiar friends of our household
1242. in those days. The former achieved brilliant successes both as a writer
1243. and as a lecturer. He was greatly interested in the anti-slavery
1244. agitation; “His eloquent voice was raised more than once in the cause
1245. of human freedom.” The younger members of our family remember him best
1246. for his ready and delightful wit. The fact that he was decidedly homely
1247. seemed to give additional point to his funny sayings. Mrs. Whipple was
1248. as handsome as her husband was plain--sweet-tempered and sympathetic,
1249. yet not wanting in firmness.
1250. 
1251. Before publishing the poem the author made a number of changes, all
1252. of which are, as I think, improvements. The last verse, which is an
1253. anticlimax, was cut out altogether.
1254. 
1255. We find from her letters that she hesitated to allow the publication of
1256. the original draft of the “Battle Hymn”[24] because it contained this
1257. final verse. She did not consider it equal to the rest of the poem.[25]
1258. After consulting other literary people, in her usual painstaking way,
1259. she decided to have the first draft published.[26] It will be noted
1260. that in the first verse “vintage” has been substituted for “wine
1261. press.” The first line of the third verse read originally,
1262. 
1263.   I have read a burning gospel writ in fiery rows of steel.
1264. 
1265. The later version,
1266. 
1267.   I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:
1268. 
1269. brings out more clearly the image of the long lines of bayonets as they
1270. glittered in her sight on that autumn afternoon. In the fourth verse
1271. the second line was somewhat vague in the first draft,
1272. 
1273.   He has waked the earth’s dull bosom with a high ecstatic beat,
1274. 
1275. The allusion was probably to the marching feet of the armed multitude.
1276. The new version,
1277. 
1278.   He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat:
1279. 
1280. is more direct and simple, hence accords better with the deeply
1281. religious tone of the poem.
1282. 
1283. In the last stanza,
1284. 
1285.   In the whiteness of the lilies he was born across the sea,
1286. 
1287. now reads,
1288. 
1289.   In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
1290. 
1291. A number of people have asked the meaning of this line. The allusion
1292. is evidently to the lilies carried by the angel, in pictures of the
1293. annunciation to the Virgin, these flowers being the emblem of purity.
1294. 
1295. The original version of the second line read,
1296. 
1297.   With a glory in his bosom that shines out on you and me,
1298. 
1299. The present words,
1300. 
1301.   Transfigures you and me,
1302. 
1303. give us a clearer and more beautiful image. The passion of the poem
1304. seems, indeed, to lift on high and glorify our poor humanity.
1305. 
1306. It is interesting to note that my mother associated with her husband
1307. the line,
1308. 
1309.   _He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat_;
1310. 
1311. Not long before her death, new buildings were erected at Watertown,
1312. Massachusetts, for the Perkins Institution for the Blind, founded and
1313. administered for more than forty years by Dr. Howe. His son-in-law,
1314. Michael Anagnos, ably continued the work during thirty more years.
1315. 
1316. When we were talking about a suitable inscription in memory of the
1317. latter, I suggested to my mother the use of this line. The answer was,
1318. “_No, that is for your father._”
1319. 
1320. The original draft of the “Battle Hymn” is dated November, 1861; it
1321. was published in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for February, 1862. The verses
1322. were printed on the first page, being thus given the place of honor.
1323. According to the custom of that day, no name was signed to them. James
1324. T. Fields was then editor of the magazine. My mother consulted him with
1325. regard to a name for the poem. It was he, as I think, who christened
1326. it “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” The price paid for it was five
1327. dollars. But the true price of it was a very different thing, not to
1328. be computed in terms of money. It brought its author name and fame
1329. throughout the civilized world, in addition to the love and honor of
1330. her countrymen. As she grew older and the spiritual beauty of her life
1331. and thought shone out more and more clearly, the affection in which she
1332. was held deepened into something akin to veneration.
1333. 
1334. The “Battle Hymn” soon found its way from the pages of the _Atlantic
1335. Monthly_ into the newspapers, thence to army hymn-books and broadsides.
1336. It has been printed over and over again, in a great variety of forms,
1337. sometimes with the picture of the author, as in the Perry prints. A
1338. white silk handkerchief now in my possession bears the line,
1339. 
1340.   Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
1341. 
1342. worked in red embroidery silk.
1343. 
1344. My mother was called upon to copy the poem times without number. While
1345. she was very willing to write a line or even, upon occasion, a verse
1346. or two, she objected very decidedly, especially in her later years,
1347. to copying the whole poem. Always responsive to the requests of the
1348. autograph fiend, she felt that so much should not be asked of her. For
1349. it naturally took time and trouble to make the fair copy that came up
1350. to her standard. It was with some difficulty that I persuaded her to
1351. send a promised copy to Edmund Clarence Stedman, for his collection.
1352. 
1353. “But mamma, you _said_ you would write it out for him.”
1354. 
1355. With a roguish twinkle, she replied, “Yes, but I did not say _when_.”
1356. 
1357. However, the verses were duly executed and sent to the banker-poet.
1358. 
1359. “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” has been translated into Spanish,
1360. Italian, Armenian, and doubtless other languages. New tunes have been
1361. composed for it, but they have failed of acceptance. My mother dearly
1362. loved music and was a trained musician, hence her choice of a tune was
1363. no haphazard selection. She wrote her poem to the “John Brown” air and
1364. they cannot be divorced.
1365. 
1366. I have been so fortunate as to secure from Franklin B. Sanborn an
1367. account of the origin of the words and music of the “John Brown” song.
1368. Mr. Sanborn, biographer of Thoreau, John Brown, and others, is the last
1369. survivor of the brilliant group of writers belonging to the golden age
1370. of New England literature.

1372.                                                  CONCORD, MASS., _1916_.
1373. 
1374.   DEAR MRS. HALL--I investigated quite thoroughly the air to which the
1375.   original John Brown folk song was set;...
1376. 
1377.   I happened to be in Boston the day that Fletcher Webster’s regiment
1378.   (the 12th Mass. Volunteers) came up from Fort Warren, landed on Long
1379.   Wharf, and marched up State Street past the old State House, on
1380.   their way to take the train for the Front, in the summer of 1861.
1381.   As they came along, a quartette, of which Capt. Howard Jenkins,
1382.   then a sergeant in this regiment, was a tenor voice, was singing
1383.   something sonorous, which I had never heard. I asked my college
1384.   friend Jacobsen, of Baltimore, who stood near me, “What are they
1385.   singing?” He replied, “That boy on the sidewalk is selling copies.”
1386.   I approached him and bought a handbill which, without the music,
1387.   contained the rude words of the John Brown song, which I then heard
1388.   for the first time, but listened to a thousand times afterward
1389.   during the progress of the emancipating Civil War--before they were
1390.   superseded by Mrs. Howe’s inspired lines, which now take their place
1391.   almost everywhere.
1392. 
1393.   The chorus was borne by the marching soldiers, who had practised
1394.   it in their drills at the Fort; indeed, it had been adapted from
1395.   a camp-meeting hymn to a marching song, for which it is admirably
1396.   fitted, by the bandmaster of Col. Webster’s regiment, and afterward
1397.   revised by Dodworth’s military band, then the best in the country.
1398.   It was this thrilling music, with its resounding religious chorus,
1399.   which Mrs. Howe, in company with our Massachusetts Governor Andrew,
1400.   heard near the Potomac, the next November, in the evening camps that
1401.   encircled Washington.
1402. 
1403.                                    Yours ever,
1404.                                                           F. B. SANBORN.
1405. 
1406. The following account of Mrs. Howe’s visit to Washington and of the
1407. circumstances connected with the writing of the “Battle Hymn” was
1408. written by Mr. A. J. Bloor, assistant secretary of the U. S. Sanitary
1409. Commission:
1410. 
1411. “JULIA WARD HOWE
1412. 
1413. “It was the writer’s privilege to be introduced early in the Civil War
1414. to Julia Ward Howe, the author of ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic,’
1415. and now, through the fullness of her days, the dean of American
1416. literature, though recognized long ago as having employed her high
1417. gift of utterance not merely as the magnet to attract to herself an
1418. advantageous celebrity, but paramountly as the instrument for the
1419. righting of wrong and the amelioration of the current conditions of
1420. humanity.
1421. 
1422. “I was presented to Mrs. Howe by her husband, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe,
1423. a companion of Lord Byron in aiding the Greeks to throw off the yoke of
1424. the Turks, and the philanthropist who opened the gates of hope to the
1425. famous Laura Bridgman, born blind, deaf, and dumb. Dr. Howe invented
1426. various processes by which he rescued her from her living tomb, as
1427. he subsequently did others born to similar deprivations, and he was
1428. careful to leave on record such exhaustive and clear statements as
1429. to his methods that, after his decease, the track was well illumined
1430. wherein later any well-doer for other victims in like case might open
1431. to them, through their single physical sense of touch, the doors
1432. leading to all earthly knowledge so far stored in letters....
1433. 
1434. “Dr. Howe, on the outbreak of the Civil War, consented to serve as a
1435. member of the U. S. Sanitary Commission, a volunteer organization of
1436. influential Union men, springing from a central association in New York
1437. City for the relief of the forces serving in the war, and consisting of
1438. a few Union ladies, one of whom, Miss Louisa Lee Schuyler, suggested
1439. the formation of a similar but larger and wider-spread body of men,
1440. representing the Union sentiment of the whole North, into which her own
1441. society should be merged as one of--so it turned out--many branches.
1442. 
1443. “Such a body was accordingly enrolled and, with Dr. Bellows, a
1444. prominent Unitarian clergyman of the day, as its president, was
1445. appointed a commission, by President Lincoln, as a _quasi_ Bureau
1446. of the War Department, to complement the appliances and work of the
1447. Government’s Medical Bureau and Commissariat, which, at the sudden
1448. outbreak of the war, were very deficient.
1449. 
1450. “Of this commission I was the assistant secretary, with headquarters
1451. at its central office in Washington.... On the occasion of General
1452. McClellan’s first great review of the Army of the Potomac--numbering
1453. at that time about seventy thousand men--at Upton’s Hill, in Virginia,
1454. not far from the enemy’s lines, Dr. Howe asked me to accompany him
1455. thither on horseback to see it, which I did. Mrs. Howe had preceded
1456. us, with several friends, by carriage, and it was there, in the
1457. midst of the blare and glitter and bedizened simulacra of actual and
1458. abhorrent warfare, that he did me the honor of presenting me to his
1459. wife, then known, outside her private circle, only as the author of a
1460. book of charming lyrical essays; but for years since recognized, and
1461. doubtless, in the future, will be adjudged, the inspired creator of a
1462. war song which for rapt outlook, reverent mysticism, and stateliness of
1463. expression, as well as for more widely appreciated patriotic ardor, has
1464. more claim, in my estimation, to be styled a hymn than not a few that
1465. swell the pages of some of our hymnals. I have always thought it an
1466. honor even for the Sanitary Commission with all its noble work of help
1467. to the nation in its straits, and of mercy to the suffering, that Julia
1468. Ward Howe’s ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’ should have been written on
1469. paper headed ‘U. S. Sanitary Commission,’ as may be seen by a facsimile
1470. of it in her delightful volume of reminiscences. It seems a pity that
1471. Mrs. Howe, an accomplished musical composer in private, as well as a
1472. poet in public, should not herself have set the air for her own words
1473. in that famous utterance of insight, enthusiasm, and prophecy.”
1474.

1476. 
1477. 
1478. V
1479. 
1480. THE ARMY TAKES IT UP
1481. 
1482. Gloom in Libby Prison, July 6, 1863--The victory of
1483.   Gettysburg--Chaplain McCabe sings “Mine eyes have seen the glory of
1484.   the coming of the Lord”--Five hundred voices take up the chorus--The
1485.   “Battle Hymn” at the national capital--The great throng shout,
1486.   sing, and weep--Abraham Lincoln listens with a strange glory on his
1487.   face--The army takes up the song.
1488. 
1489. 
1490. “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” was inspired by the tremendous issues
1491. of the war, as they were brought vividly to the poet’s mind by the
1492. sight of the Union Army.
1493. 
1494. My mother had seen all that she describes--she had been a part of the
1495. great procession of “burnished rows of steel” when her carriage was
1496. surrounded by the Army. She had heard the soldiers singing:
1497. 
1498.   “John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the grave,
1499.       His soul is marching on.”
1500. 
1501. Old John Brown who had
1502. 
1503.   Died to make men free,
1504. 
1505. whose spirit the army knew to be with them!
1506. 
1507. All this sank deeply into the heart of the poet. The soul of the Army
1508. took possession of her. The song which she wrote down in the gray
1509. twilight of that autumn morning voiced the highest aspirations of
1510. the soldiers, of the whole people. Hence, when the armies of freedom
1511. heard it, they at once hailed it as their own. My mother writes in her
1512. _Reminiscences_:
1513. 
1514. “The poem, which was soon after published in the _Atlantic Monthly_,
1515. was somewhat praised on its appearance, but the vicissitudes of the war
1516. so engrossed public attention that small heed was taken of literary
1517. matters. I knew, and was content to know, that the poem soon found its
1518. way to the camps, as I heard from time to time of its being sung in
1519. chorus by the soldiers.”
1520. 
1521. This was the beginning, but the interest increased as the “Battle Hymn”
1522. became more and more widely known, until it grew to be one of the
1523. leading lyrics of the war. It was “sung, chanted, recited, and used in
1524. exhortation and prayer on the eve of battle.” “It was the word of the
1525. hour, and the Union armies marched to its swing.”
1526. 
1527. The “singing chaplain”--Rev. Charles Cardwell McCabe of the 122d Ohio
1528. Regiment of Volunteers, did much to popularize this war lyric. Reading
1529. it in the _Atlantic Monthly_, he was so charmed with the lines that
1530. he committed them to memory before arising from his chair. A year or
1531. so later, while attending the wounded men of his regiment, after the
1532. battle of Winchester (June, 1863), he was taken prisoner and carried to
1533. Libby Prison. Here he was a living benediction to the prisoners. Deeply
1534. religious by nature and blest with a cheerful, happy disposition, he
1535. kept up the spirits of his companions, ministering alike to their
1536. bodily and spiritual needs. Thus he begged three bath-tubs for them,
1537. an inestimable treasure, even though these had to serve the needs of
1538. six hundred men. Books, too, he procured for them, for the prisoners
1539. at this time comprised a notable company of men--doctors, teachers,
1540. editors, merchants, lawyers. “We bought books when we needed bread,”
1541. the chaplain tells us.
1542. 
1543. With the music of his wonderful voice he was wont to dispel the gloom
1544. that often settled upon the inmates of the prison. Many stories are
1545. told of its power, pathos, and magnetism. Whenever the dwellers in old
1546. Libby felt depression settling upon their spirits they would call out,
1547. “Chaplain, sing us a song.” Then “The heavy load that oppressed us all
1548. seemed as by magic to be lifted.”
1549. 
1550. [27]July 6, 1863, was a dark day for the prisoners. They were
1551. required to cast lots for the selection of two captains who were
1552. to be executed. These officers were taken to the dungeon below and
1553. told to prepare for death. Then the remaining men huddled together
1554. discussing the situation. The Confederate forces were marching north,
1555. and a terrible battle had been fought. Grant was striving to capture
1556. Vicksburg, the key to the Mississippi, with what result they did not
1557. know. The Richmond newspapers brought tidings of disaster to the Union
1558. armies. In startling head-lines the prisoners read: “Meade defeated
1559. at Gettysburg.” “The Northern Army fleeing to the mountains.” “Grant
1560. repulsed at Vicksburg.” “The campaign closed in disaster.”
1561. 
1562. A pall deeper and darker than death settled upon the Union prisoners.
1563. The poor, emaciated fellows broke down and cried like babies. They lost
1564. all hope. “We had not enough strength left to curse God and die,” as
1565. one of them said later.
1566. 
1567. “By and by ‘Old Ben,’ a negro servant, slipped in among them under
1568. pretense of doing some work about the prison; concealed under his coat
1569. was a later edition of the paper, on which the ink was scarcely dry.
1570. He looked around upon the prostrate host, and called out, ‘Great news
1571. in de papers.’ If you have never seen a resurrection, you could not
1572. tell what happened. We sprang to our feet and snatched the papers from
1573. his hands. Some one struck a light and held aloft a dim candle. By its
1574. light we read these head-lines:
1575. 
1576. ‘Lee is defeated! His pontoons are swept away! The Potomac is over its
1577. banks! The whole North is up in arms and sweeping down upon him!’
1578. 
1579. “The revulsion of feeling was almost too great to endure. The boys went
1580. crazy with joy. They saw the beginning of the end.” Chaplain McCabe
1581. sprang upon a box and began to sing:
1582. 
1583.   “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord--”
1584. 
1585. and the five hundred voices sang the chorus, “Glory, Glory,
1586. Hallelujah,” as men never sang before. The old negro rolled upon the
1587. floor in spasms of joy. I must not forget to add that the two captains
1588. were _not_ executed, after all.
1589. 
1590. Chaplain McCabe remained in Libby Prison until October, 1863, when
1591. an attack of typhoid fever nearly cost him his life. As soon as his
1592. health would permit, he resumed his labors in behalf of the Army, this
1593. time as a delegate of the United States Christian Commission. His
1594. deep religious feeling, of which patriotism was an integral part, had
1595. a great influence among the soldiers. Wherever he went he took the
1596. “Battle Hymn” with him. “He sang it to the soldiers in camp and field
1597. and hospital; he sang it in school-houses and churches; he sang it
1598. at camp-meetings, political gatherings, and the Christian Commission
1599. assemblies, and all the Northland took it up.”[28]
1600. 
1601. As he wrote the author:
1602. 
1603. “I have sung it a thousand times since and shall continue to sing it as
1604. long as I live. No hymn has ever stirred the nation’s heart like ‘The
1605. Battle Hymn of the Republic.’”
1606. 
1607. I must not forget to say that the singing chaplain made excellent use
1608. of this war lyric to raise funds for the work among the soldiers. With
1609. his matchless voice he sang thousands of dollars out of the people’s
1610. pockets into the treasury of the Christian Commission.
1611. 
1612. On February 2, 1864, a meeting in the interests of the Christian
1613. Commission was held in the hall of the House of Representatives at
1614. Washington. Hannibal Hamlin, Vice-President of the United States,
1615. presided. Abraham Lincoln was present, and an immense audience filled
1616. the hall. Various noted men spoke; then Chaplain McCabe made a short
1617. speech and, “by request,” sang the “Battle Hymn.” The effect on the
1618. great throng was magical. “Men and women sprang to their feet and wept
1619. and shouted and sang, as the chaplain led them in that glorious ‘Battle
1620. Hymn’; they saw Abraham Lincoln’s tear-stained face light up with a
1621. strange glory as he cried out, ‘_Sing it again!_’ and McCabe and all
1622. the multitude sang it again.”[29]
1623. 
1624. Doubtless many Grand Army posts have among their records stories of the
1625. inspiring influence of this song in times of trouble or danger. Such an
1626. anecdote was related at the Western home of Mrs. Caroline M. Severance,
1627. where Acker Post had been invited to meet my mother:
1628. 
1629. “Capt. Isaac Mahan affectingly described a certain march on a winter
1630. midnight through eastern Tennessee. The troops had been for days
1631. without enough clothing, without enough food. They were cold and wet
1632. that stormy night, hungry, weary, discouraged, morose. But some one
1633. soldier began, in courageous tones, to sing ‘Mine eyes have seen--’
1634. Before the phrase was finished a hundred more voices were heard about
1635. the hopeful singer. Another hundred more distant and then another
1636. followed until, far to the front and away to the rear, above the
1637. splashing tramp of the army through the mud, above the rattle of the
1638. horsemen, the rumble of the guns, the creaking of the wagons, and the
1639. shouts of the drivers, there echoed, louder and softer, as the rain and
1640. wind-gusts varied, the cheerful, dauntless invocation of the ‘Battle
1641. Hymn.’ It was heard as if a heavenly ally were descending with a song
1642. of succor, and thereafter the wet, aching marchers thought less that
1643. night of their wretched selves, thought more of their cause, their
1644. families, their country.”
1645. 
1646. Mr. A. J. Bloor, assistant secretary of the United States Sanitary
1647. Commission, has given us some vivid pictures of the soldiers as they
1648. sang the hymn:
1649. 
1650. “Time and again, around the camp-fires scattered at night over some
1651. open field, when the Army of the Potomac--or a portion of it--was on
1652. the march, have I heard the ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’--generally,
1653. however, the first verse only, but in endless repetition--sung in
1654. unison by hundreds of voices--occasions more impressive than that of
1655. any oratorio sung by any musical troupe in some great assembly-room.
1656. And I remember how, one night in the small hours, returning to
1657. Washington from the front, by Government steamer up the Potomac, with
1658. a party of ‘San. Com.’ colleagues and Army officers, mostly surgeons,
1659. we found our horses awaiting us at the Seventh Street dock; and how,
1660. mounting them, we galloped all the long distance to our quarters,
1661. singing the ‘Battle Hymn’--this time the whole of it--at the top of our
1662. voices.”
1663. 
1664. 
1665. 
1666. 
1667. VI
1668. 
1669. NOTABLE OCCASIONS WHERE IT HAS BEEN SUNG
1670. 
1671. By great crowds in the street after Union victories in the Civil
1672.   War--On the downfall of Boss Croker--At Memorial Day celebrations
1673.   from the Atlantic to the Pacific--At the Chicago convention where the
1674.   General Federation of Women’s Clubs indorsed woman suffrage--At Brown
1675.   University and Smith College when Mrs. Howe received the degree of
1676.   LL.D.
1677. 
1678. 
1679. “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” has been sung and recited thousands
1680. of times, by all sorts of people under widely varying circumstances,
1681. yet the key-note of it is most fitly struck when men and women are
1682. lifted out of themselves by the power of strong emotion. In times of
1683. danger and of thanksgiving the “Battle Hymn” is now, as it was in the
1684. ’sixties, the fitting vehicle for the expression of national feeling.
1685. Indeed, it has been so used in other countries as well as in our own.
1686. In my mother’s journal the entry often occurs, “They sang my ‘Battle
1687. Hymn.’” Usually she makes no comment.
1688. 
1689. It would, of course, be impossible and it might be tedious to rehearse
1690. all the notable occasions where this national song has been given. Yet
1691. many of them have been so full of interest as to demand a place in the
1692. story of the “Battle Hymn.” The record would be incomplete without
1693. them. I give a few which will serve as samples.
1694. 
1695. In New York City there was a good deal of disloyal sentiment during the
1696. Civil War. Here the draft riots took place in the summer of 1863, when
1697. the guns from the battle of Gettysburg were rushed to the metropolis.
1698. Here the cannon, their wheels still deeply incrusted with mud, were
1699. drawn up, a grim reminder to the rioters of the actual meaning of war.
1700. To these the sight of a uniform was odious. My husband, David Prescott
1701. Hall, then a young lad returning from a summer camping trip, was chased
1702. through the streets by some excited individuals. As he had a knapsack
1703. on his back, they mistook him for a soldier.
1704. 
1705. It need scarcely be said that New York City had also a large loyal
1706. population. In the early days of the war men suspected of secession
1707. sympathies were visited by deputations of citizens who insisted upon
1708. their displaying the flag. They found it wiser to do so. After one
1709. of the final victories of the war, perhaps the taking of Richmond, a
1710. great crowd gathered before the bulletin-board of a New York newspaper.
1711. Some one started to sing the “Battle Hymn” and the whole mass of people
1712. took it up, “_Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!_” What else could so well have
1713. expressed the joy and thanksgiving of our people, weary of four long
1714. years of fratricidal war! My husband, who was present, described the
1715. scene as being most impressive.
1716. 
1717. F. B. Sanborn in his _Early History of Kansas_ tells us an interesting
1718. story of the singing of the “Battle Hymn” on a very different occasion.
1719. 
1720. “People were gathered together to hear a sermon from Col. James
1721. Montgomery, a man of undaunted courage and a veteran both of the Civil
1722. War and of the Kansas struggle. The place was Trading Post, where,
1723. during the Kansas troubles, some fourteen years before this time, a
1724. massacre had been perpetrated. Among his audience were survivors and
1725. relatives of the slain. There were present, too, a score of men who
1726. had ‘shouted amen when their renowned leader registered his vow that
1727. the blood of the dead and the tears of the widows and children should
1728. not be shed in vain.’ Montgomery was of the indomitable Scotch-Irish
1729. blood, tall and slender, with a shaggy shock of long black hair and
1730. even shaggier whiskers.
1731. 
1732. “As he arose to begin the services and fixed his gaze on the familiar
1733. faces of those who had suffered and whose sufferings he had so fully
1734. avenged, a gleam of joy and satisfaction seemed to blaze from his
1735. penetrating eyes and thrilled the audience into perfect accord. He
1736. hesitated a moment, and then requested all to arise and sing ‘The
1737. Battle Hymn of the Republic.’ The noble thought of that grand hymn
1738. stirred the crowd to the deepest depths of feeling. The text was in
1739. keeping with the occasion:
1740. 
1741. “‘Be not deceived. God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that
1742. shall he also reap.’
1743. 
1744. “The discourse was powerful and impressive. He reminded his hearers
1745. of his prophecy that the remaining years of slavery could be numbered
1746. on the fingers of one hand, and that he should lead a host of negro
1747. soldiers, arrayed in the national uniform, in the redemption of the
1748. country from the curse of slavery. A few days afterward the old
1749. Covenanter was dead!”
1750. 
1751. To the Grand Army of the Republic Julia Ward Howe was especially dear.
1752. On Memorial Day a detachment always visits and decorates her grave,
1753. with simple but impressive ceremonies. Upon that of her husband, which
1754. lies next to hers, the Greeks always lay flowers. This festival of
1755. remembrance comes only three days after my mother’s birthday, May 27th.
1756. In 1899, when she was eighty years of age, the ceremonies in Boston
1757. were of unusual interest.
1758. 
1759. The Grand Army of the Republic held a celebration in Boston Theater,
1760. Major-General Joseph Wheeler, formerly an officer in the Confederate
1761. Army, having been invited to deliver the address. Mrs. Howe rode
1762. thither in an open carriage with the general’s two daughters, “_very_
1763. pleasant girls.”
1764. 
1765. The Philadelphia _Press_ thus describes the occasion:
1766. 
1767. “BOSTON WARMED UP
1768. 
1769. “The major has just returned from Boston, where he was present at the
1770. Memorial Day services held in Boston Theater.
1771. 
1772. “It was the real thing. I never imagined possible such a genuine
1773. sweeping emotion as when that audience began to sing the ‘Battle Hymn.’
1774. If Boston was cold, it was thawed by the demonstration on Tuesday.
1775. Myron W. Whitney started to sing. He bowed to a box, in which we first
1776. recognized Mrs. Howe, sitting with the Misses Wheeler. You should have
1777. heard the yell. We could see the splendid white head trembling; then
1778. her voice joined in, as Whitney sang, ‘In the beauty of the lilies,’
1779. and by the time he had reached the words, ‘As He died to make men holy,
1780. let us die to make men free,’ the whole vast audience was on its feet,
1781. sobbing and singing at the top of its thousands of lungs. If volunteers
1782. were really needed for the Philippines, McKinley could have had us all
1783. right there.”
1784. 
1785. This was in her adopted city of Boston, where she had lived for more
1786. than half a century. The Grand Army men of California gave her a
1787. similar reception on Memorial Day, 1888.
1788. 
1789. We quote extracts from the San Francisco papers describing it:
1790. 
1791. “The Grand Opera House never contained a larger audience. Not only were
1792. all the chairs taken up but every inch of standing-room was pre-empted.
1793. There were many persons who could not gain an entrance.... Mr. Dibble
1794. next called the attention of the audience to the fact that Mrs. Julia
1795. Ward Howe, the author of ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic,’ was among
1796. the guests of the evening.
1797. 
1798. “At this juncture an enthusiastic gentleman in one of the front seats
1799. sprang up and called for three cheers for Mrs. Howe. They were given
1800. with a vim, Mrs. Howe acknowledging the compliment by rising and
1801. bowing.... The next event upon the program was the singing of ‘The
1802. Battle Hymn of the Republic’ by J. C. Hughes. The singing was preceded
1803. by a scene rarely witnessed and which was not on the printed program.
1804. General Salomon introduced Mrs. Howe to the audience in an appreciative
1805. speech.
1806. 
1807. “A beautiful floral piece was then presented to Mrs. Howe, which she
1808. acknowledged in fitting terms, while the audience gave three cheers and
1809. a tiger for the author of ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic.’
1810. 
1811. “Mrs. Howe advanced to the footlights, beaming with pleasure. She then
1812. said:
1813. 
1814. “‘My dear friends, I cannot, with my weak voice, reach this vast
1815. assemblage; but I will endeavor to have some of you hear me. I join in
1816. this celebration with thrilled and uplifted heart. I remember those
1817. camp-fires, I remember those dreadful battles. It was a question with
1818. us women, “Will our men prevail? Until they do, they will not come
1819. home.” How we blessed them when they did; how we blessed them with our
1820. prayers when they were on the battle-field. Those were times of sorrow;
1821. this is one of joy. Let us thank God who has given us these victories.’
1822. 
1823. “As Mrs. Howe was about to resume her seat the audience rose _en
1824. masse_, and from the dress-circle to the upper gallery rung a round of
1825. cheers.
1826. 
1827. “The audience remained standing while Mr. Hughes sang the stirring
1828. words of the hymn, and joined heartily in the chorus as by request.
1829. At the last chorus Mrs. Howe stepped forward and joined in the song,
1830. closing with a general flutter of handkerchiefs.”
1831. 
1832. My mother visited the Pacific coast twice in the latter years of her
1833. life, as her beloved sister, Mrs. Adolphe Mailliard, then lived there.
1834. She was received in a way that was very gratifying to her and her
1835. family.
1836. 
1837. One of the most dearly prized privileges of a self-governing people
1838. is that of constant grumbling over the administration of affairs and
1839. of finding fault with our rulers--who, in the last analysis, are
1840. ourselves. In England men write to the _Times_; in America we write
1841. to many papers and we complain endlessly. This would evidently be
1842. impossible under a despotic Government, and it sometimes seems as
1843. if we indulged too freely in depreciating our own country and its
1844. institutions. Yet deep down in the hearts of our people is a love
1845. of our native land which flames forth brightly on great occasions.
1846. The country which produced the “Battle Hymn” is not lacking in true
1847. patriotism. So long as our people use it to express their deepest
1848. emotions we need fear no serious treason to the Republic. The danger
1849. of our frequent fault-finding is that we thus allow our righteous
1850. indignation to evaporate in mere words.
1851. 
1852. Supineness in politics, an indolence which permits unworthy men to
1853. usurp the reins of government, is one of our great sins as a nation.
1854. Yet the corrupt manipulator who goes too far meets an uprising of
1855. popular indignation which thoroughly surprises him. From the New York
1856. _Sun_ we quote the story of such a day of retribution.
1857. 
1858. At the downfall of Boss Croker “a throng gathered in Madison Square.
1859. Not even in a Presidential election in recent years have there been
1860. such innumerable hosts as gathered in front of the Fifth Avenue Hotel
1861. and the Hoffman House last night to hear of the doom of Croker and
1862. his cronies. Cheer upon cheer ascended when the mighty army read that
1863. Low was far ahead and would win in the great battle.” Some one struck
1864. up the “Battle Hymn.” “All over the square were heard the thousands
1865. singing this great hymn.... There has not been such a scene in New York
1866. City since war days.”
1867. 
1868. Among the notable occasions we must certainly count the unveiling
1869. of the Shaw Monument. Here the art of St.-Gaudens has preserved in
1870. immemorial stone the story of Robert Gould Shaw and his colored
1871. soldiers, the heroes of Fort Wagner. The monument stands just within
1872. old Boston Common, facing the State House. The ceremonies of dedication
1873. included a procession and a meeting in Music Hall, where Prof. William
1874. James and Booker Washington made the principal addresses, and the
1875. “Battle Hymn” was sung.
1876. 
1877. My mother is best known as the author of the “Battle Hymn.” Soon after
1878. the war she began her efforts in behalf of the woman’s cause, which
1879. eventually won for her the great affection of her countrywomen as well
1880. as a reputation extending to foreign shores. She was deeply interested
1881. both in the club and in the suffrage movement. She lived to see the
1882. full flowering of the former and the partial success of the latter.
1883. Despite the many weary trials and delays she never lost faith in the
1884. ultimate victory of the suffrage cause. “I shall live to see women win
1885. the franchise in New York State,” she declared, not many years before
1886. her death.
1887. 
1888. In the early days of the club movement my mother, like most of her
1889. fellow-suffragists, thought it best not to mingle the two issues.
1890. While the more advanced thinkers among the club women believed in the
1891. enfranchisement of their sex, the majority did not.
1892. 
1893. At last the two movements--like two rapidly flowing streams that have
1894. long been drawing nearer together--joined in one mighty river. I have
1895. often wished my mother could have lived to see that wonderful day at
1896. Chicago when the General Federation of Women’s Clubs--an association
1897. comprising more than one and a half million women--declared themselves,
1898. amid cheers and tears, in favor of votes for women. Every one was
1899. deeply moved; the delegates embraced one another, and the “Battle Hymn”
1900. was sung--a hymn this time of joyous thanksgiving for the victory
1901. obtained, yet of solemn dedication, too, to the hard labor still to be
1902. performed before the good fight could be fully won.
1903. 
1904. My mother describes one occasion where the “Battle Hymn” was given in
1905. dumb show before the Association for the Advancement of Women. She
1906. was very much attached to this pioneer society, of which she was the
1907. president during many years. The association held annual congresses
1908. in different parts of the United States, the proceedings eliciting
1909. much interest. When they were at X---- one of the members invited
1910. the society to visit a school for young girls of which she was the
1911. principal.
1912. 
1913. “After witnessing some interesting exercises we assemble in the large
1914. hall, where a novel entertainment has been provided for us. A band of
1915. twelve young ladies appear upon the platform. They wear the colors of
1916. ‘Old Glory,’ but after a new fashion, four of them being arrayed from
1917. head to foot in red, four in blue, and four in white. While the ‘John
1918. Brown’ tune is heard from the piano, they proceed to act in graceful
1919. dumb show the stanzas of my ‘Battle Hymn.’ How they did it I cannot
1920. tell, but it was a most lovely performance.”[30]
1921. 
1922. In the early days of the woman movement a hard struggle was
1923. necessary in order to secure for girls the advantages of the higher
1924. education. Into this my mother threw herself with her accustomed
1925. zeal. A lifelong student and lover of books, she ardently desired to
1926. secure for other women the advantages she herself so highly prized.
1927. Enjoying robust health, and accustomed to prolonged mental labor,
1928. she never doubted the capacity of her sex for serious study. So,
1929. despite the gloomy prognostications of learned doctors (all men),
1930. she and her fellow-suffragists persevered until the battle was won.
1931. Thus it was very fitting that the three institutions which bestowed
1932. honorary degrees upon her--Tufts College, Brown University, and Smith
1933. College--all counted women among their students. Her youngest daughter,
1934. Maud Howe Elliott, thus describes the scene at Providence:[31]
1935. 
1936. “On June 16th (1909) Brown University, her husband’s _alma mater_
1937. and her grandfather’s, conferred upon her the degree of Doctor of
1938. Laws.... Her name was called last. With the deliberate step of age, she
1939. walked forward, wearing her son’s college gown over her white dress,
1940. his mortar-board cap over her lace veil. She seemed less moved than
1941. any person present; she could not see what we saw, the tiny gallant
1942. figure bent with four score and ten years of study and hard labor.
1943. As she moved between the girl students who stood up to let her pass,
1944. she whispered: ‘How tall they are! It seems to me the girls are much
1945. taller than they used to be.’ Did she realize how much shorter she was
1946. than she once had been? I think not. Then, her eyes sparkling with fun
1947. while all other eyes were wet, she shook her hard-earned diploma with
1948. a gay gesture in the faces of those girls, cast on them a keen glance
1949. that somehow was a challenge, ‘Catch up with me if you can!’” The band
1950. played the air of the “Battle Hymn” and applause followed her as she
1951. went back to her seat.
1952. 
1953. “She had labored long for the higher education of women, suffered
1954. estrangement, borne ridicule for it--the sight of those girl graduates,
1955. starting on their life voyage equipped with a good education, was
1956. like a sudden realization of a lifelong dream, uplifted her, gave her
1957. strength for the fatigues of the day.”
1958. 
1959. A similar scene was enacted in October, 1910, shortly before her death,
1960. when Smith College conferred the same degree upon her.
1961. 
1962. “Opposite the platform, as if hung in air, a curving gallery was
1963. filled with white-clad girls, some two thousand of them; as she entered
1964. they rose like a flock of doves, and with them the whole audience. They
1965. rose once more when her name was called, last in the list of those
1966. honored with degrees, and as she came forward, the organ pealed, and
1967. the great chorus of fresh young voices broke out with--
1968. 
1969.   “‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,’
1970. 
1971. “It was the last time.”[32]
1972. 
1973. 
1974. 
1975. 
1976. VII
1977. 
1978. HOW AND WHERE THE AUTHOR RECITED IT
1979. 
1980. The simplicity and deep earnestness of her manner--Her clear and
1981.   musical voice which never grew old--How Susan B. Anthony “mixed up”
1982.   two songs--Gladdened by the love and honor which it brought her, Mrs.
1983.   Howe repeats the “Battle Hymn” in all parts of the country before
1984.   all sorts of audiences, small and great--Why its appeal to the human
1985.   heart is universal.
1986. 
1987. 
1988. It may be imagined that the heart of the woman who wrote the “Battle
1989. Hymn” was greatly gladdened by the love and honor which it brought
1990. her. She enjoyed to the full the beautiful affection shown her by
1991. her countrymen and countrywomen, and, in my opinion, her happy and
1992. sympathetic relations with them prolonged her life. She was glad to
1993. live, despite the physical weakness of old age, because she knew that
1994. she was widely beloved and could still be of use. Her mind remained
1995. clear and brilliant to the very last.
1996. 
1997. The honors paid her she received with the humility that dreads
1998. over-praise. In her journal she questions her worthiness to be made so
1999. much of, and hopes to the end that she may be able to do something of
2000. value to mankind.
2001. 
2002. The recital of her “Battle Hymn” gave so much pleasure that she was
2003. very willing to repeat it, under suitable circumstances. She was asked
2004. to do so at all times and seasons and in all sorts of places. People
2005. who requested her to recite her war lyric at the close of a lecture did
2006. not realize the fatigue that it entailed upon a person no longer young
2007. and already weary with speaking. Yet I doubt if she ever refused, when
2008. it was possible for her to comply with the request. Not long before her
2009. death, some ladies, calling upon her at her summer home near Newport,
2010. begged her to recite then and there the “Battle Hymn.” She was loth to
2011. do so, feeling the solemn words were not at all in keeping with the
2012. light and pleasant chat of a morning visit. As one of the callers was
2013. frankly an old lady, my mother at length consented. According to her
2014. custom when asked to recite under such circumstances, she withdrew for
2015. a few minutes before beginning.
2016. 
2017. There are thousands of people now living, I suppose, who have heard
2018. the author’s recitation of the “Battle Hymn.” Yet because there are
2019. thousands who never did hear it, and because these things slip so
2020. easily out of mind, it is well to give some description of it “_Lest we
2021. forget_.”
2022. 
2023. My mother repeated the verses of the hymn simply, yet with a solemnity
2024. that was all the more impressive because there was no effort at
2025. elocutionary or dramatic effect. Yet there was sufficient variety in
2026. the recitation to avoid any approach to monotony. Thus she repeated the
2027. lines
2028. 
2029.   “O be swift, my soul, to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet!”
2030. 
2031. with uplifted hands, a downward glance at her feet, and voice slightly
2032. raised. Her distinct enunciation and the clear, musical tones of a
2033. voice that never grew old, made the words audible even in a large
2034. auditorium.
2035. 
2036. Her deeply serious manner, corresponding so well as it did with the
2037. solemn, prophetic words of the “Battle Hymn,” made the recitation very
2038. impressive.
2039. 
2040. We saw before us the woman who had been privileged to speak the word
2041. for the hour, in the dark days of her country’s history. It was like
2042. seeing some priestess of old delivering the sacred oracle to her
2043. people. Though the message was repeated so many times, it never lost
2044. its power to stir the souls of those who heard it.
2045. 
2046. It should be said that the habit of speaking very carefully, my mother
2047. formed early in life. Having a brother who stammered, she was very
2048. anxious to avoid that defect of speech. The beauty of her voice was due
2049. to its careful training in the Italian school of singing in her youth.
2050. Doubtless the habit of public speaking also tended to preserve it.
2051. 
2052. She occasionally repeated “The Flag,” a more dramatic and more personal
2053. poem than the “Battle Hymn.” Her rendering of it, accordingly, was more
2054. dramatic.
2055. 
2056. On public occasions my mother was often introduced as “The author of
2057. ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic.’” Sometimes the introducer would, by
2058. mistake, substitute the name of another war song, good of its kind,
2059. but hardly to be compared with my mother’s hymn. She used to say,
2060. rather plaintively, that Miss Susan B. Anthony (the well-known suffrage
2061. leader) _would_ mix up the two songs, introducing her as “_The author
2062. of the ‘Battle Cry of Freedom.’_”
2063. 
2064. It was a joy to her to be associated with the “Battle Hymn,” yet she
2065. sometimes grieved a little because this so greatly overshadowed all her
2066. other literary productions. She had labored long and earnestly with
2067. pen and voice, writing both prose and poetry which won commendation
2068. from her comrades in the world of letters. Hence she was glad to be
2069. remembered as the author, not only of her war lyric, but of other
2070. compositions as well.
2071. 
2072. My mother was asked to repeat this more and more often as its fame
2073. increased and as she herself became ever dearer to her countrymen. As
2074. early as 1865 we find that she was urged to recite it at Newport at
2075. the close of her lecture in Mr. Richard Hunt’s studio. Among those in
2076. the audience was George Bancroft, the historian, a prominent figure
2077. in Newport society of the olden days. Mr. Bancroft had held various
2078. offices under the Federal Government, that of Secretary of the Navy
2079. among others. When the Civil War broke out there was a good deal of
2080. secession feeling among the summer residents of the watering-place, but
2081. Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft were steadfastly loyal to the Union.
2082. 
2083. It is interesting to note that among the many places where its author
2084. recited the “Battle Hymn,” at least one city in the heart of the South
2085. is included. Mrs. Howe spent the winter of 1884-85 in New Orleans,
2086. having been invited to preside over the woman’s department of the
2087. exposition held there in that year.
2088. 
2089. The experience involved much hard work, but also much pleasure. She
2090. made many friends in the Crescent City, whither she and I returned
2091. eleven years later for a congress of the Association for the
2092. Advancement of Women. We were the guests of her old friend, Mrs. King,
2093. the mother of Grace King, the novelist, and were entertained by mother
2094. and daughters with charming hospitality.
2095. 
2096. I confess that it surprised me when, at an afternoon reception in the
2097. King drawing-room, my mother was asked to repeat the “Battle Hymn,” and
2098. did so. This showed us how much the old ill-feeling between North and
2099. South had died out. It demonstrated also the universal and therefore
2100. non-sectional quality of the poem, of which more will be said in the
2101. following chapter.
2102. 
2103. The “Battle Hymn” may be called universal in still another sense, since
2104. it appeals to men and women of all religious creeds. When Mrs. Howe was
2105. especially requested to recite it before a council of Jewish women,
2106. it gave her “an unexpected thrill of satisfaction.” She was warmly
2107. received and welcomed, but felt some anxiety lest the verse beginning
2108. “In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea” might
2109. disturb her hearers. The president assured her, however, that there
2110. was nothing in it to hurt their feelings.
2111. 
2112. My mother was so intimately associated with the woman movement that she
2113. was called upon to repeat her war lyric before many feminine audiences.
2114. We have spoken of her interest in women’s clubs. She was also
2115. interested in the patriotic societies, being a member of the D. A. R.
2116. and of the Colonial Dames of Rhode Island. One of the Boston chapters
2117. of the former is named in honor of the Old South Meeting-house, a
2118. venerated landmark of the city. When the congregation left their old
2119. place of worship and moved to the Back Bay, it required a tremendous
2120. effort on the part of the women of Boston to raise the necessary funds
2121. and to save the historic building from destruction. Here, in December,
2122. 1906, the Old South Chapter had a meeting where there was “much good
2123. speaking.” My mother recited her “Battle Hymn” and told them something
2124. of her Revolutionary ancestors. She remembered her forebears with
2125. affectionate pride as noble men and women whose example she strove to
2126. imitate.
2127. 
2128. A long life brings its penalties as well as its pleasures. Living to
2129. the age of nearly ninety-two years, my mother survived all the friends
2130. of her youth and most, if not all, of her contemporaries. Hence she
2131. was called upon to attend many funerals, considering this a duty, in
2132. accordance with old-fashioned ideas. A temporary lameness prevented her
2133. attending the obsequies of the poet Longfellow, an early friend of her
2134. husband’s, whom she also had known well for many years. She was able,
2135. however, to testify to her friendship for the gentle poet by giving her
2136. services for the Longfellow Memorial held at the Boston Museum. Here
2137. she took part in an authors’ reading, reciting the “Battle Hymn,” as
2138. well as some verses composed in honor of the poet.
2139. 
2140. That she should be invited to do so shows a great change in public
2141. opinion since the early years of their acquaintance. In the ’forties
2142. and ’fifties it was not thought fitting that a lady should even sign
2143. her name to a poem or a novel, much less read it in public. When my
2144. mother published some verses in a volume edited by Mr. Longfellow in
2145. those early days, they appeared as anonymous. By his advice, her first
2146. book of poems, _Passion Flowers_, bore no name upon the title-page.

2154. 
2155. From Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Conan Doyle, Ralph Waldo
2156.   Emerson, William Dean Howells,[33] U. S. Senator George F. Hoar,
2157.   Thomas Starr King, Ina Coolbrith, and others--The “Battle Hymn” and
2158.   the “Marseillaise”--What Rudyard Kipling said of it in “The Light
2159.   that Failed”--English reprints distributed among the soldiers of the
2160.   present war.
2161. 
2162. 
2163. The appeal of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” is so wide that it
2164. takes in all classes of mankind, all, at least, who love freedom.
2165. 
2166.   Wherever rise the peoples,
2167.     Wherever sinks a throne,
2168.   The throbbing heart of freedom
2169.     Finds an answer in his own.
2170. 
2171. So wrote the poet Whittier of Samuel Gridley Howe, remembering his
2172. services to the Greeks, to the Poles and others. The lines are equally
2173. true of his wife, Julia Ward Howe, and of the spirit animating her war
2174. lyric. Although written in the midst of the greatest civil war that was
2175. ever fought and won, there is no word of North or South, no appeal to
2176. local pride or patriotism, no word of sectional strife or bitterness.
2177. The God to whom appeal is made is the God of freedom. The enemy to be
2178. overcome, the serpent who is to be crushed beneath the heel of the
2179. hero, is slavery.
2180. 
2181. It is amusing and yet sad to find that some literal souls have fancied
2182. that my mother intended to designate the Southerners by “the grapes of
2183. wrath.” Needless to say that the writer intended no such narrow and
2184. prosaic meaning.
2185. 
2186. The “Battle Hymn” may well be compared to the “Marseillaise.” The
2187. man is to be pitied who can hear either of them without a thrill
2188. of answering emotion. Both have the power to move their hearers
2189. profoundly, yet they are as different as the two nationalities which
2190. gave them birth. The French national hymn appeals to us by its
2191. wonderfully stirring music more than by the words. We can imagine
2192. how the latter aroused to a frenzy of feeling the men of the French
2193. Revolution, when they rose to throw off the yoke of centuries of
2194. oppression and misrule. Feudalism perished in France to the fiery music
2195. of the “Marseillaise.” Slavery died in America to the old “John Brown”
2196. tune, as slow and steadfast in movement as the Northern race who sang
2197. it.
2198. 
2199. In our war lyric we seem to hear an echo of the old cry, “The sword of
2200. the Lord and of Gideon.” Yet we did not fully recognize its tremendous
2201. power until Kipling christened it “_The terrible Battle Hymn of the
2202. Republic_.”
2203. 
2204. In the closing scene of _The Light that Failed_[34] we are shown a
2205. group of English newspaper correspondents about to start for a war
2206. in the Soudan. They are met together for a last evening of song and
2207. merrymaking, yet one of their number “by the instinct of association
2208. began to hum the terrible Battle Hymn of the Republic. Man after man
2209. caught it up--it was a tune they knew well, till the windows shook to
2210. the clang, the Nilghai’s deep voice leading:
2211. 
2212.   “‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.’”
2213. 
2214. Sir A. Conan Doyle pays a similar tribute to its power in _Through the
2215. Magic Door_:
2216. 
2217. “Take the songs which they sang during the most bloody war which the
2218. Anglo-Celtic race has ever waged--the only war in which it could have
2219. been said that they were stretched to their uttermost and showed their
2220. true form ... all had a playful humor running through them. Only one
2221. exception do I know, and that is the most tremendous war song I can
2222. recall; even an outsider in time of peace can hardly read it without
2223. emotion. I mean, of course, Julia Ward Howe’s war song of the Republic,
2224. with the choral opening line,
2225. 
2226.   ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.’
2227. 
2228. If that were ever sung upon a battle-field the effect must have been
2229. terrific.”
2230. 
2231. During the present war in Europe, an English lady has had a large
2232. number of copies of the “Hymn” printed and distributed, through the
2233. Young Men’s Christian Association, to the soldiers. They contain the
2234. following explanation: “This magnificent ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’
2235. was written in 1861 by a famous American lady, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,
2236. for the Army of the Northern States of America, which were then engaged
2237. in a ‘Holy War’ to rid the South of slavery and to preserve the Union
2238. of the States. It is said to have done more to awaken the spirit of
2239. patriotism and to have inspired more deeds of heroism than any other
2240. event of the American Civil War.”
2241. 
2242. It is pleasant and heartening to read these tributes of praise from
2243. distinguished Englishmen. That our “Battle Hymn of the Republic” should
2244. so strongly appeal to them shows us the essential unity of the two
2245. great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race, even though oceans roll between
2246. Great Britain and America.
2247. 
2248. The strange glory that came over the face of Abraham Lincoln and the
2249. tears he shed on hearing the “Battle Hymn” will always be, for his
2250. countrymen, the most precious tribute to its power.
2251. 
2252. “The chaplain afterward stated that in his conversation with Mr.
2253. Lincoln at his reception, the President said to him, ‘Take it all in
2254. all, the song and the singing, that was the best I ever heard.’”[35]
2255. 
2256. To the steadfast and courageous soul of another great American, who
2257. also has held the high office of President of these United States,
2258. Theodore Roosevelt, this war hymn strongly appealed. His book, _Fear
2259. God and Take Your Own Part_, is prefaced by “The Battle Hymn of the
2260. Republic” and by the following dedication:
2261. 
2262.   “This book is dedicated to the memory of
2263.   JULIA WARD HOWE
2264. 
2265. because in the vital matters fundamentally affecting the life of the
2266. Republic she was as good a citizen of the Republic as Washington and
2267. Lincoln themselves. She was in the highest sense a good wife and a good
2268. mother, and therefore she fulfilled the primary law of our being. She
2269. brought up with devoted care and wisdom her sons and her daughters.
2270. At the same time she fulfilled her full duty to the commonwealth from
2271. the public standpoint. She preached righteousness and she practised
2272. righteousness. She sought the peace that comes as the handmaiden of
2273. well-doing. She preached that stern and lofty courage of soul which
2274. shrinks neither from war nor from any other form of suffering and
2275. hardship and danger if it is only thereby that justice can be served.
2276. She embodied that trait more essential than any other in the make-up of
2277. the men and women of this Republic--the valor of righteousness.”
2278. 
2279. In the letter given below, Hon. George F. Hoar, United States Senator
2280. from Massachusetts, compares “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” with the
2281. “Marseillaise” and with the “British National Anthem.”
2282. 
2283.                                        WORCESTER, MASS., _May 22, 1903_.
2284. 
2285.   I was thinking, just as I got your letter asking me to send a
2286.   greeting to your meeting and to Mrs. Howe, of the great power, in
2287.   framing the character of nations, of their National Anthems. Fletcher
2288.   of Saltoun said, as every child knows, “Let me make the songs of a
2289.   people, and I care not who make their laws.” No single influence has
2290.   had so much to do with shaping the destiny of a nation, as nothing
2291.   more surely expresses national character, than what is known as the
2292.   National Anthem. France adopted for hers the “Marseillaise.” Its
2293.   stirring appeal
2294. 
2295.     Sons of France, awake to glory!
2296. 
2297.   led the youth of France to march through Europe, subduing kingdoms
2298.   and overthrowing dynasties, till “forty centuries looked down on them
2299.   from the pyramids.” At last the ambition of France perished and came
2300.   to grief, as every unholy ambition is destined to perish and come to
2301.   grief, and her great Emperor died in exile at St. Helena.
2302. 
2303.   Is there anything more cheap and vulgar than the National Anthem of
2304.   our English brethren, “God Save the King”?
2305. 
2306.     O Lord our God, arise!
2307.     Scatter his enemies
2308.       And make them fall.
2309.     Confound their politics,
2310.     Frustrate their knavish tricks;
2311.     On him our hopes we fix;
2312.       God save us all!
2313. 
2314.   England, I hope, knows better now. But she has acted on that motto
2315.   for a thousand years.
2316. 
2317.   New England’s Anthem,
2318. 
2319.     The breaking waves dashed high,
2320. 
2321.   one of the noblest poems in all literature, was written by a woman.
2322. 
2323.   We waited eighty years for our American National Anthem. At last God
2324.   inspired an illustrious and noble woman to utter in undying verse
2325.   the thought which we hope is forever to animate the soldier of the
2326.   Republic.
2327. 
2328.     In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
2329.     With a glory in His bosom which transfigures you and me;
2330.     As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
2331.                               While God is marching on!
2332. 
2333.   Julia Ward Howe cannot yet vote in America. But her words will be an
2334.   inspiration to the youth of America on many a hard-fought field for
2335.   liberty many a century after her successors will vote.
2336. 
2337.                                  I am faithfully yours,
2338.                                                          GEORGE F. HOAR.
2339. 
2340.   MISS ALICE STONE BLACKWELL.
2341. 
2342. In the journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson we find this tribute to his
2343. friend, Julia Ward Howe:
2344. 
2345. “I honour the author of the ‘Battle Hymn’ and of ‘The Flag.’ She was
2346. born in the city of New York. I could well wish she were a native of
2347. Massachusetts. We have had no such poetess in New England.”
2348. 
2349. The little bit of State pride voiced in the regret that my mother was
2350. not a native of the old Bay State, surprises us in a man of such wide
2351. sympathies as Mr. Emerson. In Whittier’s early poems also the local
2352. feeling is strongly pronounced. We should remember, however, that
2353. during the nineteenth century a good deal of sectional feeling still
2354. existed in the different States. The twentieth century finds us more
2355. closely united as a people than we have ever been before.
2356. 
2357. Edmund Clarence Stedman happily characterizes the war hymn in the
2358. following passage. It occurs in a letter to me, asking that my mother
2359. would copy it for him.
2360. 
2361. “I can well understand what a Frankenstein’s monster such a creation
2362. grows to be--such a poem as the ‘Battle Hymn’ when it has become the
2363. sacred scroll of millions, each one of whom would fain obtain a copy of
2364. it.”[36]
2365. 
2366. Those who have visited the White Mountains will remember that one of
2367. the peaks is called “Starr King.” It was named for Thomas Starr King,
2368. a noted Unitarian preacher in the middle of the nineteenth century.
2369. Shortly before the Civil War he accepted a call to San Francisco. In
2370. addition to officiating in the church there he soon took upon his
2371. shoulders a task that was too heavy for his somewhat frail physique.
2372. This was nothing less than persuading the people of California to
2373. remain loyal to the Union. There was a good deal of secession sentiment
2374. on the Pacific coast in 1861. Starr King and his fellow-Unionists
2375. succeeded in their undertaking, but he paid the penalty of overwork
2376. with his life. Hence his memory is beloved and revered on the shores
2377. of the Pacific as well as on those of the Atlantic. One can imagine
2378. what the “Battle Hymn” must have meant to him, weary as he was with his
2379. strenuous labors. He pronounced it “a miraculously perfect poem.”
2380. 
2381. Another “Spray of Western Pine” was contributed to the garland of
2382. praise by Ina Coolbrith, one of the last survivors of the golden age of
2383. California literature.
2384. 
2385.   JULIA WARD HOWE
2386. 
2387.   When with the awful lightning of His glance,
2388.     Jehovah, thro’ the mighty walls of sea
2389.     His people led from their long bondage free,--
2390.   A Woman’s hand, too light to lift the lance,
2391.   Miriam, the Prophetess, with song and dance,
2392.     With timbrel, and with harp and psaltery,
2393.     Struck the proud notes of triumphs yet to be,
2394.     And voiced her Israel’s deliverance.
2395. 
2396.   So in our own dear Land, in strife to save
2397.     Another race oppressed, when light grew dim,
2398.     And the Red Sea of blood loomed fatefully
2399.   To overwhelm, the God of freedom gave
2400.     Thro’ Woman’s lips His sacred battle hymn
2401.       That rang thro’ combat on to victory!
2402. 
2403. When memorial services were held in honor of my mother, Boston’s
2404. great Symphony Hall was crowded to its utmost capacity. Many were
2405. the beautiful tributes to her given by men and women of national
2406. reputation. None, however, equaled in heartfelt eloquence the speech of
2407. Lewis, the distinguished negro lawyer. As he poured out the gratitude
2408. of his race to the woman who had written “The Battle Hymn of the
2409. Republic,” I suddenly realized for the first time what the words meant
2410. to the colored people.
2411. 
2412.   As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.
2413. 
2414. “To make us, black men and black women, free!” The appeal was to the
2415. white men of our country, bidding them share the freedom they so
2416. dearly prized with the despised slave. And this triumphant gospel of
2417. liberty with its stirring chorus of “Glory, glory, hallelujah” was
2418. sung wherever the Northern army went. It was the first proclamation of
2419. emancipation. If it moves us, how must it have affected the people to
2420. whom it was a prophecy of the longed-for deliverance from bondage.
2421. 
2422. 
2423. 
2424. 
2425. IX
2426. 
2427. MRS. HOWE’S LESSER POEMS OF THE CIVIL WAR
2428. 
2429. Her poetic tribute to Frederick Douglass--“Left Behind,” “Our
2430.   Orders,” “April 19”--“The Flag” followed the second battle of Bull
2431.   Run--“The Secesh” in the Newport churches--“The First Martyr,” “Our
2432.   Country,” “Harvard Student’s Song,” “Return”--How “Our Country” lost
2433.   its musical setting--“The Parricide” written on the day of Lincoln’s
2434.   funeral to express her reverence.
2435. 
2436. 
2437. My mother’s natural mode of expressing herself was by poetry rather
2438. than by prose. She wrote verses from her earliest years up to the time
2439. of her death. It is true that some of her best work took the form of
2440. prose in her essays, lectures, and speeches,[37] yet whenever her
2441. feelings were deeply moved she turned to verse as the fittest vehicle
2442. for her use.
2443. 
2444. We have seen that she began to write poems protesting against human
2445. slavery at an early period of her career. Thus her first published
2446. “On the Death of the Slave Lewis.” In _Words for the Hour_ we find
2447. several poems dealing with slavery, the struggle in Kansas, the
2448. attack on Sumner, and kindred subjects. The titles of these and some
2449. quotations from them are given in Chapter I. The verses on “Tremont
2450. Temple” contain tributes to Sumner and Frederick Douglass, the negro
2451. orator. The first two are as follows: volume, _Passion Flowers_ (1853),
2452. contained verses
2453. 
2454.   Two figures fill this temple to my sight,
2455.     Whoe’er shall speak, their forms behind him stand;
2456.   One has the beauty of our Northern blood,
2457.     And wields Jove’s thunder in his lifted hand.
2458. 
2459.   The other wears the solemn hue of Night
2460.     Drawn darker in the blazonry of pain,
2461.   Blotting the gaslight’s mimic day, he slings
2462.     A dangerous weapon, too, a broken chain.
2463. 
2464. When the Civil War broke out, she poured forth the feelings that
2465. so deeply moved her in a number of poems. “The Battle Hymn of the
2466. Republic” is the best known of these, as it deserves to be. The
2467. others, however, while varying as to merit, show the same patriotism,
2468. indignation against wrong, and elevation of spirit. The woman’s
2469. tenderness of heart breathes through them, too, as in the story of the
2470. dying soldier:
2471. 
2472.   LEFT BEHIND
2473. 
2474.   The foe is retreating, the field is clear;
2475.   My thoughts fly like lightning, my steps stay here;
2476.   I’m bleeding to faintness, no help is near:
2477.         What, ho! comrades; what, ho!
2478. 
2479.   The battle was deadly, the shots fell thick;
2480.   We leaped from our trenches, and charged them quick;
2481.   I knew not my wound till my heart grew sick:
2482.         So there, comrades; so there.
2483. 
2484.   We charged the left column, that broke and fled;
2485.   Poured powder for powder, and lead for lead:
2486.   So they must surrender, what matter who’s dead?
2487.         Who cares, comrades? who cares?
2488. 
2489.   My soul rises up on the wings of the slain,
2490.   A triumph thrills through me that quiets the pain:
2491.   If it were yet to do, I would do it again!
2492.         Farewell, comrades, farewell!
2493. 
2494. It will be remembered that the first blood shed in the Civil War was
2495. in Baltimore. There the Massachusetts troops, while on their way
2496. to defend the national capital, were attacked by “Plug-Uglies” and
2497. several soldiers were killed. My mother thus describes the funeral in
2498. Boston:[38]
2499. 
2500. “We were present when these bodies were received at King’s Chapel
2501. burial-ground, and could easily see how deeply the Governor was moved
2502. at the sad sight of the coffins draped with the national flag. This
2503. occasion drew from me the poem:
2504. 
2505.   “OUR ORDERS
2506. 
2507.   “Weave no more silks, ye Lyons Looms;
2508.     To deck our girls for gay delights!
2509.   The crimson flower of battle blooms,
2510.     And solemn marches fill the night.
2511. 
2512.   “Weave but the flag whose bars to-day
2513.     Drooped heavy o’er our early dead,
2514.   And homely garments, coarse and gray,
2515.     For orphans that must earn their bread!”
2516. 
2517. (We give the first two of the six verses.)
2518. 
2519. Other verses published in _Later Lyrics_ under the title “April 19”
2520. commemorate the same event. They were evidently written in the first
2521. heat of indignation at the breaking out of the rebellion, yet her
2522. righteous wrath always gave way to a second thought, tenderer and more
2523. merciful than the first. We see this in the last verse of the “Battle
2524. Hymn” and in various other poems of hers. The opening verses of “April
2525. 19” are:
2526. 
2527.   A spasm o’er my heart
2528.     Sweeps like a burning flood;
2529.   A sentence rings upon mine ears,
2530.     Avenge the guiltless blood!
2531. 
2532.   Sit not in health and ease,
2533.     Nor reckon loss nor gain,
2534.   When men who bear our Country’s flag
2535.     Are set upon and slain.
2536. 
2537. Of her “Poems of the War” “The Flag” ranks second in popular esteem and
2538. has a place in many anthologies. She thus describes the circumstances
2539. under which it was composed:[39]
2540. 
2541. “Even in gay Newport there were sad reverberations of the strife. I
2542. shall never forget an afternoon on which I drove into town with my son,
2543. by this time a lad of fourteen, and found the main street lined with
2544. carriages, and the carriages filled with white-faced people, intent on
2545. I knew not what. Meeting a friend, I asked: ‘Why are these people here?
2546. What are they waiting for and why do they look as they do?’
2547. 
2548. “‘They are waiting for the mail. Don’t you know that we have had a
2549. dreadful reverse?’ Alas! this was the second battle of Bull Run. I
2550. have made some record of it in a poem entitled ‘The Flag,’ which I
2551. dare mention here because Mr. Emerson, on hearing it, said to me, ‘I
2552. like the architecture of that poem.’”
2553. 
2554. The opening verse is as follows:
2555. 
2556.   There’s a flag hangs over my threshold, whose folds are more dear to
2557.     me
2558.   Than the blood that thrills in my bosom its earnest of liberty;
2559.   And dear are the stars it harbors in its sunny field of blue
2560.   As the hope of a further heaven, that lights all our dim lives
2561.     through.
2562. 
2563. Before the war, Newport had been a favorite resort for Southerners.
2564. During the summer of 1861 a number were still there, and it must be
2565. confessed some of them behaved with very little tact. According to
2566. reports current at the time, these individuals carried politics inside
2567. the church doors. When the prayer for the President of the United
2568. States was read, they arose from their knees in order to show their
2569. disapproval. At its conclusion they again knelt. Women would draw
2570. aside the voluminous skirts then in fashion, to prevent their coming
2571. in contact with the United States flag. I have always fancied that the
2572. lines in “The Flag,”
2573. 
2574.   Salute the flag in its virtue, or pass on where others rule,
2575. 
2576. were inspired by this behavior of “The Secesh,” as we then called them.
2577. Some of these persons, although belonging to good society, had the bad
2578. taste to boast in our presence of how the South was going to “whip” the
2579. North. At a certain picnic among the Paradise Rocks, my mother resolved
2580. to give these people a lesson in patriotism. One of our number, a
2581. quiet, elderly lady, was selected to act as America, the queen of the
2582. occasion. She was crowned with flowers, and we all saluted her with
2583. patriotic songs.
2584. 
2585. “The First Martyr” tells the story of a visit to the wife of John Brown
2586. before the latter’s execution:
2587. 
2588.   My five-years’ darling, on my knee,
2589.   Chattered and toyed and laughed with me;
2590.   “Now tell me, mother mine,” quoth she,
2591.     “Where you went i’ the afternoon.”
2592.   “Alas! my pretty little life,
2593.   I went to see a sorrowing wife,
2594.     Who will be widowed soon.”
2595. 
2596.          *       *       *       *       *
2597. 
2598.   Child! It is fit that thou shouldst weep;
2599.   The very babe unborn would leap
2600.   To rescue such as he.
2601. 
2602. “Our Country” contains no word about the civil strife, although it is
2603. classed with “Poems of the War” in her volume entitled _Later Lyrics_.
2604. A prize was offered for a national song while the war was in progress,
2605. and Mrs. Howe sent in this poem, Otto Dresel composing the music. Mr.
2606. Dresel was a prominent figure in the musical world of Boston for many
2607. years and wrote a number of charming songs.
2608. 
2609. The prize which had been offered for the national song was never
2610. awarded, if I remember aright, and Mr. Dresel decided to use the tune
2611. he had composed, for the “Army Hymn” of Oliver Wendell Holmes. This was
2612. “superbly sung by L. C. Campbell, assisted by the choir and band” at
2613. the opening exercises of the Great Metropolitan Fair held in New York
2614. during the Civil War, for the benefit of the Sanitary Commission.
2615. 
2616. “Our Country” thus lost its musical setting, to my mother’s regret.
2617. 
2618.   OUR COUNTRY
2619. 
2620.   On primal rocks she wrote her name,
2621.     Her towers were reared on holy graves,
2622.   The golden seed that bore her came
2623.     Swift-winged with prayer o’er ocean waves.
2624. 
2625.   The Forest bowed his solemn crest,
2626.     And open flung his sylvan doors;
2627.   Meek Rivers led the appointed Guest
2628.     To clasp the wide-embracing shores;
2629. 
2630.   Till, fold by fold, the broidered Land
2631.     To swell her virgin vestments grew,
2632.   While Sages, strong in heart and hand,
2633.     Her virtue’s fiery girdle drew.
2634. 
2635.   O Exile of the wrath of Kings!
2636.     O Pilgrim Ark of Liberty!
2637.   The refuge of divinest things,
2638.     Their record must abide in thee.
2639. 
2640.   First in the glories of thy front
2641.     Let the crown jewel Truth be found;
2642.   Thy right hand fling with generous wont
2643.     Love’s happy chain to furthest bound.
2644. 
2645.   Let Justice with the faultless scales
2646.     Hold fast the worship of thy sons,
2647.   Thy commerce spread her shining sails
2648.     Where no dark tide of rapine runs.
2649. 
2650.   So link thy ways to those of God,
2651.     So follow firm the heavenly laws,
2652.   That stars may greet thee, warrior-browed,
2653.     And storm-sped angels hail thy cause.
2654. 
2655.   O Land, the measure of our prayers,
2656.     Hope of the world, in grief and wrong!
2657.   Be thine the blessing of the years,
2658.     The gift of faith, the crown of song.
2659. 
2660. The news of Lincoln’s assassination dealt a stunning blow to our
2661. people. The rejoicings over the end of the Civil War were suddenly
2662. changed to deep sorrow, indignation, and fear. How widely the
2663. conspiracy spread we did not know. It will be remembered that other
2664. officers of the Federal Government were attacked. My mother wrote that
2665. nothing since the death of her little boy[40] had given her so much
2666. personal pain. As usual, she sought relief for her feelings in verse.
2667. “The Parricide,” written on the day of Lincoln’s funeral, expresses her
2668. love and reverence for the great man, her horror of the “Fair assassin,
2669. murder--white,” whom she bids:
2670. 
2671.   With thy serpent speed avoid
2672.     Each unsullied household light,
2673.   Every conscience unalloyed.
2674. 
2675. As usual, compassion followed anger. “Pardon,” written a few days
2676. later, after the death of Wilkes Booth, is the better poem of the two.
2677. 
2678.   PARDON
2679. 
2680.   WILKES BOOTH--APRIL 26, 1865
2681. 
2682.   Pains the sharp sentence the heart in whose wrath it was uttered,
2683.         Now thou art cold;
2684.   Vengeance, the headlong, and Justice, with purpose close muttered,
2685.         Loosen their hold.
2686. 
2687.   Death brings atonement; he did that whereof ye accuse him,--
2688.         Murder accurst;
2689.   But, from that crisis of crime in which Satan did lose him,
2690.         Suffered the worst.
2691. 
2692.   Back to the cross, where the Saviour uplifted in dying
2693.         Bade all souls live,
2694.   Turns the reft bosom of Nature, his mother, low sighing,
2695.         Greatest, forgive!
2696. 
2697. On July 21, 1865, Harvard University held memorial exercises in honor
2698. of her sons who had given their lives for their country. The living
2699. graduates of that day numbered only twenty-four hundred, including the
2700. aged, sick, and absent. Of these more than five hundred went out to
2701. fight in behalf of the Union, many of them to return no more. Their
2702. names may be seen engraved on the marble tablets of Memorial Hall,
2703. Cambridge, a daily lesson in patriotism to the undergraduates who
2704. frequent it. Full of fun and nonsense as the latter are, they will
2705. permit no disrespect to the memory of the heroes of the Civil War. If
2706. visitors enter without removing their hats, an instant clamor arises,
2707. forcing them to do so.
2708. 
2709. On this Commencement day of 1865 a notable assemblage gathered at
2710. Harvard. In addition to other distinguished people there were present,
2711. as Governor Andrew said in his address, a “cloud of living witnesses
2712. who have come back laden with glory from the fields where their
2713. comrades fell.” Phillips Brooks made a prayer, Ralph Waldo Emerson and
2714. others spoke. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Rev. Charles T. Brooks, James
2715. Russell Lowell, his brother Robert, John S. Dwight, and Mrs. Julia
2716. Ward Howe contributed poems. The verses of the latter were read by her
2717. friend, Mr. Samuel Eliot. The opening ones are as follows:
2718. 
2719.   RETURN
2720. 
2721.   They are coming, oh my Brothers, they are coming!
2722.     From the formless distance creeps the growing sound,
2723.   Like a rill-fed forest, in whose rapid summing,
2724.     Stream doth follow stream, till waves of joy abound.
2725. 
2726.   These have languished in the shadow of the prison,
2727.     Long with hunger pains and bitter fever low;
2728.   Welcome back our lost, from living graves arisen,
2729.     From the wild despite and malice of the foe.
2730. 
2731. Another of her war poems speaks in the name of the sons of the old
2732. university. When it was published in the newspapers, a careless
2733. typesetter made some errors in setting it up. I remember how troubled
2734. she was when the line
2735. 
2736.   O give them back, thou bloody breast of Treason--
2737. 
2738. was printed “beast” of Treason.
2739. 
2740. We give a single verse of the “Harvard Student’s Song”:
2741. 
2742.   Remember ye how, out of boyhood leaping,
2743.     Our gallant mates stood ready for the fray,
2744.   As new-fledged eaglets rise, with sudden sweeping,
2745.     And meet unscared the dazzling front of day?
2746.   Our classic toil became inglorious leisure,
2747.     We praised the calm Horatian ode no more,
2748.   But answered back with song the martial measure,
2749.     That held its throb above the cannon’s roar.
2750. 
2751. The other “Poems of the War” published in _Later Lyrics_ are entitled
2752. “Requital,” “The Question,” “One and Many,” “Hymn for a Spring
2753. Festival,” “The Jeweller’s Shop in War-time,” and “The Battle
2754. Eucharist.”
2755. 
2756. In these we see how deeply the writer’s soul was oppressed by the
2757. sorrow of the war and the horrors of the battle-field. We see, too, how
2758. it turned ever for comfort and encouragement to the Cross and to the
2759. Lord of Hosts.

2766. MRS. HOWE’S LOVE OF FREEDOM AN INHERITANCE
2767. 
2768. Stories of Gen. Francis Marion--Mrs. Howe’s kinship with the “Swamp
2769.   Fox”--The episode that saved “Marion’s Men”--The splendid sword
2770.   that rusted in its scabbard--John Ward, one of Oliver Cromwell’s
2771.   Ironsides--Samuel Ward, the only Colonial governor who refused to
2772.   enforce the Stamp Act--Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island and
2773.   champion of religious liberty.
2774. 
2775. 
2776. We have seen that my mother’s love of freedom was in part the result
2777. of environment. It was also an inheritance from men who had fought for
2778. civil and religious liberty, with the sword and with the pen, on both
2779. sides of the Atlantic. Of the founder of the Ward family in America, we
2780. know that he fought for the English Commonwealth and against “Charles
2781. First, tyrant of England.” He was one of Oliver Cromwell’s Ironsides,
2782. serving as an officer in a cavalry regiment. After the republic
2783. perished and the Stuart line in the person of Charles II. returned to
2784. the throne, doughty old John Ward came to America, bringing his good
2785. sword with him. Whether it was ever used on this side of the water, the
2786. record does not say, but it was preserved in the family for nearly a
2787. century.
2788. 
2789. His descendants held positions of trust and responsibility under the
2790. State, his grandson and great-grandson being each in his turn governor
2791. of Rhode Island. The latter, Gov. Samuel Ward, has the distinction
2792. of being the only Colonial governor who refused to take the oath to
2793. enforce the Stamp Act. As the Chief Executive of “little Rhody” was
2794. chosen by the people, his views were naturally more democratic than
2795. those of governors appointed by the crown. Still, it took courage to
2796. refuse to obey the royal mandate. He early foresaw the separation
2797. from Great Britain and wrote to his son in 1766, “These Colonies are
2798. destined to an early independence, and you will live to see my words
2799. verified.” He was a member of the Continental Congresses of 1774 and
2800. 1775. The latter resolved itself into a committee of the whole almost
2801. every day, and Governor Ward was constantly called to the chair on such
2802. occasions, until he was seized with fatal illness, March 13, 1776,
2803. dying soon afterward.
2804. 
2805. At this time vaccination had not been discovered, the only preventive
2806. of the terrible scourge of smallpox being inoculation. Now Governor
2807. Ward could not spare time for the brief illness which this process
2808. involved. In addition to his duties in Congress he was obliged, owing
2809. to the physical disability of his colleague, Gov. Stephen Hopkins, to
2810. conduct all the official correspondence of the Rhode Island delegation,
2811. with the Government and citizens of the colony. His services were
2812. required on many committees, notably on the secret committee which
2813. contracted for arms and munitions of war. Hence, worn down by overwork,
2814. he fell an easy victim to smallpox. He died three months before his
2815. colleagues signed the Declaration of Independence. As he early saw the
2816. necessity of separation from the mother country, he would certainly
2817. have affixed his signature to it had he lived. His descendants may be
2818. pardoned for thinking that he made a great mistake in not taking the
2819. time required for inoculation.
2820. 
2821. Many of Governor Ward’s letters have been preserved. These show his
2822. ardent patriotism as well as the devout religious spirit of the men of
2823. 1776. He writes to his brother: “I have realized with regard to myself
2824. the bullet, the bayonet, and the halter; and compared with the immense
2825. object I have in view they are all less than nothing. No man living,
2826. perhaps, is more fond of his children than I am, and I am not so old as
2827. to be tired of life; and yet, as far as I can now judge, the tenderest
2828. connections and the most important private concerns are very minute
2829. objects. Heaven save my country! I was going to say is my first, my
2830. last, and almost my only prayer.”
2831. 
2832. Gov. Samuel Ward was a Seventh-Day Baptist. The little church in which
2833. he worshiped at Newport has all the charm of the best architecture of
2834. that period. It now forms part of the Historical Society’s rooms.
2835. 
2836. His son, Lieut.-Col. Samuel Ward, grandfather of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,
2837. joined the Continental Army when the Revolution broke out. Governor
2838. Ward writes of “the almost unparalleled sufferings of Samuel,” and
2839. these were indeed severe. Of the ill-fated expedition to Quebec,
2840. Colonel Ward writes: “We were thirty days in a wilderness that none
2841. but savages ever attempted to pass. We marched one hundred miles upon
2842. shore with only three days’ provisions, waded over three rapid rivers,
2843. marched through snow and ice barefoot ... moderately speaking, we have
2844. waded one hundred miles.” The result of this exposure was “the yellow
2845. jaundice.”
2846. 
2847. The Americans were overpowered by superior numbers, Colonel Ward being
2848. taken prisoner with many others. He was also at Valley Forge in that
2849. terrible winter when the American Army endured such great privations.
2850. 
2851. It is interesting to note that Colonel Ward assisted in raising a
2852. colored regiment in the spring of 1778. He commanded this in the
2853. engagement on the island of Rhode Island, near the spot where his
2854. granddaughter and her husband established their summer home a century
2855. later. From the peaceful windows of “Oak Glen” one sees, in the near
2856. foreground, the earthworks of the Revolution.
2857. 
2858. In spite of all the hardships endured during the Revolutionary War,
2859. Colonel Ward lived to be nearly seventy-six years of age. My mother
2860. well remembered her grandfather with his courtly manner and mild,
2861. but very observing, blue eyes. With the indulgence characteristic of
2862. grandparents, he permitted the Ward brothers to play cards at his
2863. house, a thing they were forbidden to do at home.
2864. 
2865. The State of Rhode Island is represented in the statue-gallery of the
2866. national Capitol by Roger Williams, pioneer of religious liberty and
2867. founder of the State, and by Gen. Nathaniel Greene, who rendered such
2868. important service during the Revolutionary War. My mother was related
2869. to both men, being a direct descendant of the former.
2870. 
2871. Whether or no Massachusetts was justified in driving out Roger
2872. Williams, we will not attempt to decide. He was evidently a person who
2873. delighted in controversy in a day when religious toleration was almost
2874. unknown.
2875. 
2876. To him belongs the honor of being the first to found a State “upon the
2877. distinctive principle of complete separation of Church and State.”
2878. Maryland followed not long after the example set by the “State of Rhode
2879. Island and Providence Plantations.”
2880. 
2881. Not in Massachusetts alone did people object to his doctrines. His
2882. work, _The Bloody Tenent of Persecution_, was burned in England by the
2883. common hangman, by order of Parliament.
2884. 
2885. _George Fox Digged Out of His Burrowe_ seems a volume of formidable
2886. proportions to the modern reader. With Quaker doctrines Roger Williams
2887. had small patience, although he permitted members of the persecuted
2888. sect to live in the Colony. It seems that G. Fox did not avail himself
2889. of an offer of disputation on fourteen proposals. His opponents
2890. claimed that he “slily departed” to avoid the debate. It went on
2891. just the same, being “managed three days at Newport and one day at
2892. Providence.”
2893. 
2894. This volume, _George Fox_, etc.[41], is dedicated to Charles II. by
2895. “Your Majestyes most loyal and affectionate Orator at the Throne of
2896. Grace.”
2897. 
2898. One can guess how much attention the Merrie Monarch paid to the
2899. fourteen “proposalls”[42] and the elaboration thereof.
2900. 
2901. The best testimony to the essential gentleness and goodness of this
2902. eccentric divine is the behavior toward him of the Indians. During King
2903. Philip’s war they marched on Providence with the intention of burning
2904. it.
2905. 
2906. “The well-attested tradition is that Roger Williams, now an old man,
2907. alone and unarmed, save with his staff, went out to meet the band of
2908. approaching Indians. His efforts to stay their course were unavailing,
2909. but they allowed him to return unmolested, such was the love and
2910. veneration entertained for him by these savages.”
2911. 
2912. Of my mother’s ancestors on the maternal side, the most interesting was
2913. her great-great-uncle, Gen. Francis Marion, the partisan leader of the
2914. Revolution. She was descended from his sister Esther, “The Queen Bee of
2915. the Marion Hive,” the general himself having no children.
2916. 
2917. Many romantic stories are told of him. He was present at a
2918. drinking-party during the siege of Charleston when the host, determined
2919. that no one should leave the festivities until some particularly fine
2920. Madeira had been disposed of, locked the door and threw the key out of
2921. the window. Marion had no notion of taking part in any excesses, so
2922. he made his escape by jumping out of the window. A lame ankle was the
2923. result, and the Huguenot left the city, all officers unfit for duty
2924. being ordered to depart. Marion took refuge now with one friend, now
2925. with another, and again he was obliged to hide in the woods, while
2926. recovering from this lameness. The accident was a most fortunate one,
2927. however. If he had remained in Charleston he would have been obliged to
2928. surrender and the brigade of “Marion’s Men” might never have existed.
2929. 
2930. How he formed it in the darkest hour of the war in the South is a
2931. matter of history. How, like so many will-o’-the-wisps, they led the
2932. British a weary dance “thoro’ bush, thoro’ brier,” all through the
2933. woods and the swamps of South Carolina, is a tale that delights the
2934. heart of every school-boy.
2935. 
2936.   Well knows the fair and friendly moon
2937.     The men that Marion leads,
2938.   The glitter of the rifles,
2939.     The scamper of their steeds;
2940.   ’Tis life to guide the fiery barb
2941.     Across the moonlit plain:
2942.   ’Tis life to feel the night-wind
2943.     That lifts the tossing mane.
2944.   A moment in the British camp,
2945.     A moment and away,
2946.   Back to the pathless forest
2947.     Before the peep of day.[43]
2948. 
2949. The best-known story tells of the British officer who was brought
2950. blindfolded into Marion’s camp and entertained at a dinner consisting
2951. solely of sweet potatoes. Small wonder that he made up his mind the
2952. Americans could not be conquered, since they were able to subsist on
2953. such scanty rations!
2954. 
2955. Reversing the text of Scripture, General Marion provided his men with
2956. swords made of saws, ammunition being scanty. He was as well known for
2957. his humanity as for his ingenuity. It is said that once, wishing to
2958. draw his sword, he found it rusted into the scabbard, so little had it
2959. been used.
2960. 
2961. When my mother, as occasionally happened in her later years, would
2962. quietly slip off on some expedition which her daughters feared was too
2963. much for her strength, we would remember her kinship with the “Swamp
2964. Fox.”
2965. 
2966. Of her parents, it should be said that both were deeply religious.
2967. Her mother, Julia Cutler Ward, a woman of very lovely character and
2968. intellectual tastes, died at the early age of twenty-seven. Her
2969. father, Samuel Ward, one of the “Merchant Princes of Wall Street,” was
2970. well known for his integrity, liberality, and public spirit. He was
2971. especially interested in the causes of temperance and religion, being
2972. “one of the foremost promoters of church-building in the then distant
2973. West.” He was also one of the founders of the New York University, and
2974. owned the first private picture-gallery in New York.
2975. 
2976. Thus we see that my mother, like so many of her fellow-Americans, came
2977. from a long line of God-fearing and patriotic men and women. In the
2978. words of the “Battle Hymn” we hear not only the voice of the Union
2979. Army, but an echo of all the aspiring thoughts and noble deeds of the
2980. builders of our great Republic.

3110. be renamed.
3111. 
3112. Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
3113. law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
3114. so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
3115. United States without permission and without paying copyright
3116. royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
3117. of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
3118. Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
3119. concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
3120. and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
3121. the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
3122. of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
3123. copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
3124. easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
3125. of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

3127. do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

3145.

3150. the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
3151. destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
3152. possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

3154. by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
3155. person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
3156. 1.E.8.
3157.

3159. used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
3160. agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
3161. things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
3162. even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
3163. paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
3164. Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

3166. electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

3170. of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
3171. works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
3172. States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
3173. United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
3174. claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
3175. displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
3176. all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
3177. that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
3178. free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
3179. works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
3180. Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
3181. comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
3182. same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
3183. you share it without charge with others.
3184. 
3185. 1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
3186. what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
3187. in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
3188. check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
3189. agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
3190. distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
3191. other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
3192. representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
3193. country other than the United States.

3201. phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
3202. performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
3203. 
3204.   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
3205.   most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
3206.   restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
3207.   under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
3208.   eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
3209.   United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where

3213. derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
3214. contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
3215. copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
3216. the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
3217. redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
3218. Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
3219. either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

3242. compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

3244. to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
3245. other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
3246. version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
3247. (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

3251. full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
3252. 
3253. 1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

3264.   to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
3265.   agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
3266.   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
3267.   within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

3296. 
3297. 1.F.
3298.

3300. effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
3301. works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
3302. Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
3303. electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
3304. contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
3305. or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
3306. intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
3307. other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

3309. 
3310. 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
3311. of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
3312. Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

3316. fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

3319. TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
3320. LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

3322. DAMAGE.
3323. 
3324. 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

3327. written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
3328. received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
3329. with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
3330. with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

3335. without further opportunities to fix the problem.
3336. 
3337. 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

3341. 
3342. 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
3343. warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
3344. damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
3345. violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
3346. agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
3347. limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
3348. unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
3349. remaining provisions.
3350. 
3351. 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
3352. trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

3355. production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
3356. electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
3357. including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
3358. the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
3359. or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
3360. additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
3361. Defect you cause.
3362. 
3363. Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
3364. 
3365. Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
3366. electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
3367. computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
3368. exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
3369. from people in all walks of life.
3370. 
3371. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
3372. assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
3373. goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
3374. remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
3375. Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
3376. and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
3377. generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
3378. Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
3379. Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
3380. www.gutenberg.org
3381. 
3382. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
3383. Archive Foundation
3384. 
3385. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
3386. 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
3387. state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
3388. Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
3389. number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
3390. Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
3391. U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
3392. 
3393. The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
3394. Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
3395. to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
3396. and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
3397. 
3398. Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
3399. Literary Archive Foundation
3400. 
3401. Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
3402. widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
3403. increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
3404. freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
3405. array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
3406. ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
3407. status with the IRS.
3408. 
3409. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
3410. charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
3411. States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
3412. considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
3413. with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
3414. where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
3415. DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
3416. state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
3417. 
3418. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
3419. have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
3420. against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
3421. approach us with offers to donate.
3422. 
3423. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
3424. any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
3425. outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
3426. 
3427. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
3428. methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
3429. ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
3430. donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
3431. 
3432. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
3433. 
3434. Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
3435. Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
3436. freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
3437. distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
3438. volunteer support.
3439. 
3440. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
3441. editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
3442. the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
3443. necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
3444. edition.
3445. 
3446. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
3447. facility: www.gutenberg.org
3448. 
3449. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
3450. including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
3451. Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
3452. subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
