# Slope of a line (15 points)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2,y2). 
# The program should calculate and display the slope of the line that connects the two points.
#
# The formula for the slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
#
# Format your output to five decimal places.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample output:
# 
# Enter the x-coordinate for point1: 4.5
# Enter the y-coordinate for point1: -5.5
# Enter the x-coordinate for point2: 6.6
# Enter the y-coordinate for point2: -6.5
# The slope for the line that connects two points ( 4.5 , -5.5 ) and ( 6.6 , -6.5 ) is -0.47619
